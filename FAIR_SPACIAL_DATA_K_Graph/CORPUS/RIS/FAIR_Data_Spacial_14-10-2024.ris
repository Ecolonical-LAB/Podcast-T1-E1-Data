AB  - Health data are extremely important in today's data-driven world. Through automation, healthcare processes can be optimized, and clinical decisions can be supported. For any reuse of data, the quality, validity, and trustworthiness of data are essential, and it is the only way to guarantee that data can be reused sensibly. Specific requirements for the description and coding of reusable data are defined in the FAIR guiding principles for data stewardship. Various national research associations and infrastructure projects in the German healthcare sector have already clearly positioned themselves on the FAIR principles: both the infrastructures of the Medical Informatics Initiative and the University Medicine Network operate explicitly on the basis of the FAIR principles, as do the National Research Data Infrastructure for Personal Health Data and the German Center for Diabetes Research. To ensure that a resource complies with the FAIR principles, the degree of FAIRness should first be determined (so-called FAIR assessment), followed by the prioritization for improvement steps (so-called FAIRification). Since 2016, a set of tools and guidelines have been developed for both steps, based on the different, domain-specific interpretations of the FAIR principles. Neighboring European countries have also invested in the development of a national framework for semantic interoperability in the context of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. Concepts for comprehensive data enrichment were developed to simplify data analysis, for example, in the European Health Data Space or via the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network. With the support of the European Open Science Cloud, among others, structured FAIRification measures have already been taken for German health datasets.

AB  - Well-founded data management systems are of vital importance for ocean observing systems as they ensure that essential data are not only collected but also retained and made accessible for analysis and application by current and future users. Effective data management requires collaboration across activities including observations, metadata and data assembly, quality assurance and control (QA\QC), and data publication that enables local and interoperable discovery and access and secures archiving that guarantees long-term preservation. To achieve this, data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Here, we outline how these principles apply to ocean data and illustrate them with a few examples. In recent decades, ocean data managers, in close collaboration with international organizations, have played an active role in the improvement of environmental data standardization, accessibility, and interoperability through different projects, enhancing access to observation data at all stages of the data life cycle and fostering the development of integrated services targeted to research, regulatory, and operational users. As ocean observing systems evolve and an increasing number of autonomous platforms and sensors are deployed, the volume and variety of data increase dramatically. For instance, there are more than 70 data catalogs that contain metadata records for the polar oceans, a situation that makes comprehensive data discovery beyond the capacity of most researchers. To better serve research, operational, and commercial users, more efficient turnaround of quality data in known formats and made available through Web services is necessary. In particular, automation of data workflows will be critical to reduce friction throughout the data value chain. Adhering to the FAIR principles with free, timely, and unrestricted access to ocean observation data is beneficial for the originators, has obvious benefits for users, and is an essential foundation for the development of new services made possible with big data technologies.

AB  - Background: The future European Health Research and Innovation Cloud (HRIC), as fundamental part of the European Health Data Space (EHDS), will promote the secondary use of data and the capabilities to push the boundaries of health research within an ethical and legally compliant framework that reinforces the trust of patients and citizens. Objective: This study aimed to analyse health data management mechanisms in Europe to determine their alignment with FAIR principles and data discovery generating best. practices for new data hubs joining the HRIC ecosystem. In this line, the compliance of health data hubs with FAIR principles and data discovery were assessed, and a set of best practices for health data hubs was concluded. Methods: A survey was conducted in January 2022, involving 99 representative health data hubs from multiple countries, and 42 responses were obtained in June 2022. Stratification methods were employed to cover different levels of granularity. The survey data was analysed to assess compliance with FAIR and data discovery principles. The study started with a general analysis of survey responses, followed by the creation of specific profiles based on three categories: organization type, function, and level of data aggregation. Results: The study produced specific best practices for data hubs regarding the adoption of FAIR principles and data discoverability. It also provided an overview of the survey study and specific profiles derived from category analysis, considering different types of data hubs. Conclusions: The study concluded that a significant number of health data hubs in Europe did not fully comply with FAIR and data discovery principles. However, the study identified specific best practices that can guide new data hubs in adhering to these principles. The study highlighted the importance of aligning health data management mechanisms with FAIR principles to enhance interoperability and reusability in the future HRIC.

AB  - Data is a kind of important asset in the digital economy and is driving the rise of data markets. Meanwhile, data markets promote data trading efficiently and improve the utilization of data. However, several challenges about data trading need to be addressed. Here, we resolve these challenges via our blockchain-based fair and decentralized data trading model. Disputes about data correctness is settled by the decentralized arbitration mechanism in our model. To ensure the fairness of data trading, we integrate a sale contract and a deterministic public-key encryption algorithm. The decentralization feature of blockchain cuts off the single-point failure for the data trading platform. In addition, we prove that the proposed protocol achieves the desirable security properties that a secure data trading protocol should have. Moreover, utilizing the smart contract in Solidity and program in Java, we implement our model and then evaluate its performance.

AB  - PurposeThis research aims to shed light on the utilization of open spaces at Effat University through a gender lens. By eliminating gender segregation, the study seeks to examine how these spaces are equitably shared between genders, while also delving into the realm of gender sensitive urban design (GSUD). Furthermore, the research strives to gain valuable insights into the experiences of female students in open spaces to propose a framework for the design of fair shared open spaces.Design/methodology/approachTo achieve these objectives, a multi-faceted approach was adopted. First, the research started by reviewing the literature about gender sensitive urban design and inclusive urban design to conclude the indicators examine how open spaces are shared fairly between both genders; second, an online questionnaire was administered to gather comprehensive data. Third, meticulous observations were conducted, involving the study, analysis and mapping of students' activities using maps and photos. Lastly, a walk shop was organized, with a focus group comprising of female participants. The collected data was then analyzed using SPSS descriptive statistics and the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, enabling the identification of key patterns and evaluating female students' satisfaction levels.FindingsThe findings unearth a distinctive perspective on the perception and needs of females within a unique subset of open spaces, referred to as "campus open spaces," in the context of a gender sensitive urban design. This exploration provides valuable insights into the intricacies of gender dynamics within public spaces, contributing to a more inclusive and equitable environment for all individuals at Effat University, framework shows some of significant indicators that effect on other indicators strongly as sense of safety and security and the diversity of activities that increase visiting rates, sense of belonging.Originality/valueThis research presents a framework aimed at improving the concept of equitable and inclusive, open spaces, particularly on campuses within significant communities like KSA. The focus is on creating fair shared places that facilitate interaction and cater to the social and cultural needs of students, with a particular emphasis on supporting female students. By enhancing their sense of belonging and addressing their unique requirements, this framework aims to positively impact their academic performance while fostering an inclusive and engaging campus environment.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the problem of learning fair data representations that can be used for some downstream utility task in the vendor-user setting. We propose splitting the latent space between sensitive and non-sensitive latent variables where maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is used to induce statistical independence between sensitive and non-sensitive latent variables. The non-sensitive latent representations can then be used for utility task by the user and achieve group and sub-group fairness with respect to multiple sensitive attributes. We perform extensive experiments and compare the proposed method against various representation learning methods proposed earlier in the literature. Our quantitative results and visualizations show that the proposed method produces representations that are able to achieve better or comparable performance at the utility task while simultaneously achieving sub-group and group fairness.

AB  - The data to be processed by the Tag mechanism is negligible in comparison to the conventional blockchain. Clearly, address sizes are always significantly smaller than the data size of a block. Large amounts of data in the blockchain have a time and space complexity O(n). In contrast, the tag mechanism we developed has a time and space complexity of O (1). The illustration below depicts this circumstance. Figure A compares the search performance of blocks in the blockchain and the recommended tag structure. Due to the link list structure of the blockchain, the search complexity increases linearly with the number of blocks. The search complexity is significantly reduced, however, because the tag structure we propose can accommodate any indexing mechanism, such as B+Tree. This situation is shown in Figure A. Purpose: The most fundamental problem of news sharing in the digital environment is information pollution and news circulating in false or manipulated forms or while in circulation. Our research aims to eliminate such issues in digital journalism through mechanisms of observability and traceability. Theory and Methods: To support an observable and traceable social media environment, a data model must be compatible with graph structures containing large amounts of data. Existing blockchain technologies do not support the graph data structure required by social media networks, despite providing the ability to observe and monitor. In the proposed structure, the model and data are separated, and indexing mechanisms are supported in order to address these issues. Results: The proposed data model was compared to the data model of the blockchain technology, and it was determined that the model we developed for digital journalism was more suitable in terms of time and space complexity, as well as sustainability and maintenance costs than the data model of the blockchain technology. Conclusion: In our research, a new data model was created to address the issues of digital journalism, including information pollution and disinformation. In addition to providing the FAIR principles, the data model we propose for digital journalism creates a trustworthy social media network by enabling the news to have a logical relationship with each other and all news processes to be observed. Our digital journalism model has gained observability, traceability, and FAIR compatibility due to the data structure we have developed. Thus, our model provides an environment conducive to meeting journalism standards.

AB  - Design of fair surfaces over irregular domain is a fundamental problem in computer aided geometric design (CAGD), and has applications in engineering sciences (i.e. aircraft science, automobile science and ship science etc.). In design of fair surfaces over irregular domain defined over scattered data it was widely accepted till recently that one should use Delaunay triangulation because of its global optimum property. However, in recent times it has been shown that for continuous piecewise polynomial parametric surfaces improvements in the quality of fit can be achieved if the triangulation pattern is made dependent upon some topological property of the data set or is simply data dependent. The smoothness and fairness of surface's planar cuts is important because not only it ensures favorable hydrodynamic drag, but also helps in reducing manhours during the production of the surface. In this paper we discuss a method for construction of C-1 piecewise polynomial parametric fair surfaces which interpolate prescribed R-3 scattered data using spaces of parametric splines defined on R-3 triangulation. We show that our method is more specific to the cases when the projection on 2-D plane may consist of triangles of zero area. The proposed method is fast, numerically stable and robust, and computationally inexpensive. In the present work numerical examples dealing with surfaces approximated on standard curved plates, and ship hull surface have been presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European fusion research activities have, over recent decades, generated a vast and varied set of data. The volume and diversity of the data that need to be catalogued and annotated make the task of organising and making the data available within a broader environment very challenging. Nevertheless, there are strong scientific drivers as well as incentives and mandates from national research agencies suggesting that a more coherent approach to data referencing, dissemination and sharing would provide strong benefits to the fusion research community and beyond. Here, we discuss the technical requirements and developments needed to transition the current, and future, range of fusion research data to an open and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data sharing structure guided by the principle 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'. Here we propose a set of recommendations and technical implementations needed to form a European data sharing environment for the fusion research programmes. Consistency with the emerging IMAS (ITER Integrated Modelling and Analysis Suite) infrastructure is considered to facilitate future deployments.

AB  - Purpose This paper presents results of a study on data managers' perspectives on the evolution of Designated Communities and the FAIR Principles using an example of a geological repository. Design/methodology/approach The study employed 10 semi-structured interviews with data managers at a state geological survey and qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts. Findings The Designated Community for a collection in this data repository has evolved from petroleum industry users to include academic researchers and the public. This change was accompanied by significant user interaction changes from in-person, reference interview-style conversations to anonymous digital, automated interactions. The main factors driving these changes were developments in technology which allowed the data managers to shift data discovery and access into the online environment. The online data portal has seen increasing non-expert use, driving the data team to develop additional services for these new communities. Repository data team participants varied in their familiarity with the FAIR Principles and their perceptions of the FAIRness of the data in the repository. Research limitations/implications The study was limited to one organization in the United States. However, the results are applicable to other data environments working through the tensions between high-level global frameworks such as FAIR, and continuing to serve the day-to-day needs of their designated communities. Continued work on how to assess success in this complex space is needed. Originality/value This paper lies at the nexus of two digital preservation frameworks and contributes to a limited extant literature providing guidance on implementing the concept of a Designated Community in practice.

AB  - The space-ground integrated network (SGIN) has attracted growing attention due to its advantages of high-capacity, low-latency and global coverage. To guarantee the security requirements of SGIN, anonymous authentication is an essential approach to addressing severe threats such as unauthorized access and impersonation attack, while payment is another common method in service-oriented applications in order to encourage companies to participate and also prevent insider attackers from enjoying services without paying. Existing anonymous authentication protocols for SGIN either require users to involve in heavy computation especially in dynamic scenarios, or do not consider cross-domain authentication. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of cross-company satellite services, and then address the cross-domain authentication and billing issues in SGIN, i.e., we propose a decentralized anonymous authentication scheme supporting fast handover and also achieve fairness for the billing procedures. To reduce the authentication delays, the authentication process is delegated from ground to satellites, such that users can arbitrarily switch the satellite networks belonging to different companies. Specifically, users can be anonymously authenticated by showing the knowledge of a secret bound with a randomized verifiable credential and connect to different satellite networks through a fast handover authentication protocol building on a blockchain. Even all companies collude, they cannot forge a valid identity credential and access records for a user. In addition, we provide a fair billing mechanism that can prevent malicious users and greedy satellite companies from manipulating the network accessing fees based on a well-designed smart contract. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient through security analysis and performance evaluation.

AB  - The agriculture sector is highly vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change, leading to severe impacts on food security, economic stability, and rural livelihoods. The use of geospatial information and technology has been recognized as a valuable tool to help farmers reduce the adverse impacts of natural disasters on agriculture. Remote sensing and GIS are gaining traction as ways to improve agricultural disaster response due to recent advancements in spatial resolution, accessibility, and affordability. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the FAIR agricultural disaster services. It holistically introduces the current status, case studies, technologies, and challenges, and it provides a big picture of exploring geospatial applications for agricultural disaster "from farm to space". The review begins with an overview of the governments and organizations worldwide. We present the major international and national initiatives relevant to the agricultural disaster context. The second part of this review illustrates recent research on remote sensing-based agricultural disaster monitoring, with a special focus on drought and flood events. Traditional, integrative, and machine learning-based methods are highlighted in this section. We then examine the role of spatial data infrastructure and research on agricultural disaster services and systems. The generic lifecycle of agricultural disasters is briefly introduced. Eventually, we discuss the grand challenges and emerging opportunities that range from analysis-ready data to decision-ready services, providing guidance on the foreseeable future.

AB  - Over the last 5 years, multiple stakeholders in the field of spinal cord injury (SCI) research have initiated efforts to promote publications standards and enable sharing of experimental data. In 2016, the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke hosted representatives from the SCI community to streamline these efforts and discuss the future of data sharing in the field according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data stewardship principles. As a next step, a multi-stakeholder group hosted a 2017 symposium in Washington, DC entitled "FAIR SCI Ahead: the Evolution of the Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury research." The goal of this meeting was to receive feedback from the community regarding infrastructure, policies, and organization of a community-governed Open Data Commons (ODC) for pre-clinical SCI research. Here, we summarize the policy outcomes of this meeting and report on progress implementing these policies in the form of a digital ecosystem: the Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (ODC-SCI.org). ODC-SCI enables data management, harmonization, and controlled sharing of data in a manner consistent with the well-established norms of scholarly publication. Specifically, ODC-SCI is organized around virtual "laboratories" with the ability to share data within each of three distinct data-sharing spaces: within the laboratory, across verified laboratories, or publicly under a creative commons license (CC-BY 4.0) with a digital object identifier that enables data citation. The ODC-SCI implements FAIR data sharing and enables pooled data-driven discovery while crediting the generators of valuable SCI data.

TI  - Crosswalks among stewardship maturity assessment approaches promoting trustworthy FAIR data and repositories
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
LA  - English
AB  - Various maturity assessment approaches have been developed to help research data repositories effectively manage their holdings at both the organizational and dataset levels. Repositories can use these approaches as self-assessment tools-potentially leading to formal certification-to benchmark the maturity of their data holdings, highlight gaps in their practices, and improve their sustainability. Understanding the differences among these assessment approaches can provide beneficial information on stewardship best practices for supporting FAIR data managed by Trustworthy Data Repositories. However, it is a daunting task due to diversity in the perspectives of the approaches and the potential for subjective interpretation of individual criteria. In this article, we outline the commonalities and distinctions of three established assessment approaches: i) CoreTrustSeal Trustworthy Data Repositories Requirements, ii) Data Stewardship Maturity Matrix, and iii) FAIR Guiding Principles. Strong correlations are found in data discovery, accessibility, interoperability, and usability due to overlapping requirements in digital object management. The study also reveals that the complexity of the approaches can lead to a large variety of inferred crosswalks among them.

AB  - Alongside the robots, rockets, kitchen appliances, and other technical wonders displayed at the great expositions and world's fairs of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, visitors frequently found deceptively staid demonstrations of banal bureaucratic tools: cards,fiches, and files. Yet these technologies of information management were aestheticized and presented as integral to the generation and pursuit of the fairs' ambitious 'world projects': global networks, universal intelligences, efficient cities, colonized galaxies. The small, moving parts of information functioned as critical tools for city- and world-building. In this article we begin with the 1964-5 World's Fair, where bits and fragments of information fueled (or generated?) space-age visions, then trace those mid-century imaginaries back to the 1939-40 World's Fair and a constellation of expos at the turn of the century, to see how the small, moving parts of information management 'scale up' to generate grand fantasies, and, at the same time, how they serve to index their own particular political and cultural milieux.

AB  - Design of fair surfaces over irregular domains is a fundamental problem in computer-aided geometric design (CAGD), and has applications in engineering sciences (in aircraft, automobile, ship science etc.). In the design of fair surfaces over irregular domains defined over scattered data, it was widely accepted till recently that the classical Delaunay triangulation be used because of its global optimum property. However, in recent times it has been shown that for continuous piecewise linear surfaces, improvements in the quality of fit can be achieved if the triangulation pattern is made dependent upon some topological or geometric property of the data set or is simply data dependent. The fair surface is desired because it ensures smooth and continuous surface planar cuts, and these in turn ensure smooth and easy production of the surface in CAD/CAM, and favourable, resistance properties. In this paper, we discuss a method for construction of C-1 piecewise polynomial parametric fair surfaces which interpolate prescribed. R-3 scattering data using spaces of parametric splines defined on R-3 triangulation. We show that our method is more specific to the cases when the projection on a 2-D plane may consist of triangles of zero area, numerically stable and robust, and computationally inexpensive and fast. Numerical examples dealing with surfaces approximated on plates, and on ships have been presented.

TI  - A data integration framework of additive manufacturing based on FAIR principles
T2  - MRS ADVANCES
LA  - English
AB  - Laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a popular additive manufacturing (AM) process with rich data sets coming from both in situ and ex situ sources. Data derived from multiple measurement modalities in an AM process capture unique features but often have different encoding methods; the challenge of data registration is not directly intuitive. In this work, we address the challenge of data registration between multiple modalities. Large data spaces must be organized in a machine-compatible method to maximize scientific output. FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles are required to overcome challenges associated with data at various scales. FAIRified data enables a standardized format allowing for opportunities to generate automated extraction methods and scalability. We establish a framework that captures and integrates data from a L-PBF study such as radiography and high-speed camera video, linking these data sets cohesively allowing for future exploration.

AB  - Sharing sensitive data is a specific challenge for research infrastructures in the field of life sciences. For that reason a toolbox has been developed, providing resources for researchers who wish to share and use sensitive data, to support the workflows for handling these kinds of digital objects. Common and community approved annotations are required to be compliant with FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability). The toolbox makes use of a tagging (categorisation) system, allowing consistent labelling and categorisation of digital objects, in terms relevant to data sharing tasks and activities. A pilot study was performed within the Horizon 2020 project EOSC-Life, in which 2 experts from 6 life sciences research infrastructures were recruited to independently assign tags to the same set of 10 to 25 resources related to sensitive data management and data sharing (in total 110). Summary statistics of agreement and observer variation per research infrastructure are provided. The pilot study has shown that experts were able to attribute tags but in most cases with a considerable observer variation between experts. In the context of CWFR (Canonical Workflow Frameworks for Research), this indicates the necessity for careful definition, evaluation and validation of parameters and processes related to workflow descriptions. The results from this pilot study were used to tackle this issue by revising the categorisation system and providing an updated version.

LA  - English
KW  - Caching policy
KW  - Occupancy rate
KW  - Resource allocation
AB  - Traditional cache replacement policies such as LRU and LFU were often designed with the focus on efficiency and aimed at maximizing the hit rates. However, the resource owners of modern computing systems such as cloud infrastructures and content delivery networks often have new objectives such as fairness and revenue to be optimized rather than the overall hit rate. A general resource management framework that allows resource owners to determine various resource allocations is desirable. Although such a mechanism like Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) exists for indivisible time-shared resources such as CPU and network bandwidth, no such counterpart exists for space-shared resources such as cache and main memory.(1)
   In this paper, we propose Weighted Fair Caching (WFC), a capacity-driven cache policy that provides explicitly tunable resource allocations for cache owners in terms of the occupancy rates of contents. Through analysis of the continuous-time Markov Chain model of cache dynamics, we derive the closed-form occupancy rates as a function of the weights of contents, and various properties such as monotonicity and scaling of WFC. We show that WFC can be used to provide fair sharing of cache space among contents, as well as class-based service differentiations. We evaluate the performance of WFC using real data traces from two major video providers. We find that, compared to traditional cache policies, WFC provides better fairness while sacrificing an acceptable amount of hit rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The 6G space-air-ground integrated network can achieve global full-area three-dimensional coverage and ultra-wide-area broadband access capabilities anytime and anywhere. Through the integration of satellite networks and terrestrial networks, it can provide a better user experience and has become the core development direction of 6G networks. Inspired by the potential of service differentiation ability of 6G IEEE 802.11ax protocols (Wi-Fi 6), a Data-driven Fair-Hierarchical Scheduling (DFHS) is proposed in this paper to schedule packets from diversified applications in dense Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which allows data streams to fairly share the spectrum and at the same time satisfy delay requirements. Our DFHS is divided into the outer-layer and inner-layer schedulers. First, diversified packets of IoT services are classified into categories according to delay requirement and transmission frequency. Then the outer-layer scheduler assigns classified packets to different Access Categories (AC) with differentiated channel competition capabilities. Next, the inner-layer scheduler optimally schedules the AC queues according to the packet access response ratio. Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is further introduced to solve the optimal packet scheduling problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the DFHS outperforms the classical FCFS, the latest EARS and Tian's schemes in terms of service missing ratio, queueing delay and fair index.

AB  - In this paper, we present a civil aircrafts augmented space-air-ground integrated networks (CAA-SAGIN) architecture, where each mobile user can access multiple platforms simultaneously. With the target of ensuring fairness, we put forward the fair optimization strategies including resource allocation and resource auction. In the resource allocation, we formulate a service-oriented fair (SOF) resource allocation problem in order to minimize the difference between the allocated and required data rate. After introducing convex-relaxation and logarithmic approximation, the joint optimal solutions of subchannel and power allocation can be obtained by SOF iteration algorithm. Aiming at managing the terrestrial network overload, we present a user update mechanism. After applying SOF resource allocation for selected original users in sky access platforms, we propose a resource auction scheme so as to maximize the utility for both sides. First, we decompose the original problem into several subproblems and transform them into their lower bound by first-order approximation. Then, we can obtain the joint optimal solution with an alternating descent iterative method. From simulation results, we can find that CAA-SAGIN can bring great benefits to traditional terrestrial networks. In addition, the proposed resource allocation and auction schemes are significant in terms of telecommunication and economic parameters.

AB  - The clustering problem of big data in the era of artificial intelligence has been widely studied. Because of the huge amount of data, distributed algorithms are often used to deal with big data problems. The distributed computing model has an attractive feature: it can handle massive datasets that cannot be put into the main memory. On the other hand, since many decisions are made automatically by machines in today's society, algorithm fairness is also an important research area of machine learning. In this paper, we study two fair clustering problems: the centralized fair k-center problem with outliers and the distributed fair k-center problem with outliers. For these two problems, we have designed corresponding constant approximation ratio algorithms. The theoretical proof and analysis of the approximation ratio, and the running space of the algorithm are given.

The result is a class of circle splines that robustly produce fair-looking G(2)-continuous curves without any cusps or kinks, even through rather challenging, sparse sets of interpolation points. With a simple reparameterization the curves can also be made C-2-continuous. The same method is usable in the plane, on the sphere, and in 3D space. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Satellite imagery has become a major source for identifying and mapping terrestrial and planetary landforms. However, interpretating landforms and their significance, especially in changing environments, may still be questionable. Consequently, ground truth to check training models, especially in mountainous areas, can be problematic. This paper outlines a decimal format, [dLL], for latitude and longitude geolocation that can be used for model interpretation and validation and in data sets. As data have positions in space and time, [dLL] defined points, as for images, can be associated with metadata as nodes. Together with vertices, metadata nodes help build 'information surfaces' as part of the Digital Earth. This paper examines aspects of the Critical Zone and data integration via the FAIR data principles, data that are; findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable. Mapping and making inventories of rock glacier landforms are examined in the context of their geomorphic and environmental significance and the need for geolocated ground truth. Terrestrial examination of rock glaciers shows them to be predominantly glacier-derived landforms and not indicators of permafrost. Remote-sensing technologies used to track developing rock glacier surface features show them to be climatically melting glaciers beneath rock debris covers. Distinguishing between glaciers, debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers over time is a challenge for new remote sensing satellites and technologies and shows the necessity for a common geolocation format to report many Earth surface features.

AB  - The increasing popularity of street redesigns highlights the intense competition for street space between their different users. More and more cities around the world mention in their planning documents their intention to rebalance streets in favor of active transportation, transit, and green infrastructure. However, few efforts have managed to formalize quantifiable measurements of the balance between the different users and usages of the street. This paper proposes a method to assess the balance between the three fundamental dimensions of the street-the link, the place, and the environment-as well as a method to assess the adequation between supply and demand for the link dimension at the corridor level. A series of open and government georeferenced datasets were integrated to determine the detailed allocation of street space for 11 boroughs of the city of Montreal, Canada. Travel survey data from the 2013 Origine-Destination survey was used to model different demand profiles on these streets. The three dimensions of the street were found to be most unbalanced in the central boroughs of the city, which are also the most dense and touristic neighborhoods. A discrepancy between supply and demand for transit users and cyclists was also observed across the study area. This highlights the potential of using a distributive justice framework to approach the question of the fair distribution of street space in an urban context.

AB  - This paper proposes techniques to fit and fair sequences of points together with normals or tangents at the points by matrix weighted NURBS curves. Given a set of Hermite-type data, a matrix weighted NURBS curve is constructed by choosing the input points as control points and computing the weight matrices using the normals or tangents. Unlike traditional B-spline or NURBS curves that have only linear precision, matrix weighted NURBS curves with point-normal or point-tangent control pairs have almost circular or helical precision. Matrix weighted NURBS curves constructed from Hermite-type data can be fair and fit the input points closely when the original data were regularly sampled from curves with smoothly varying tangents and curvatures. If the original data are non-uniformly spaced or noisy, fair fitting curves can still be obtained by repeatedly sampling points from previously constructed curves and constructing new matrix weighted NURBS curves using the resampled data.

AB  - Chromatic aberration is one of the quality defects in the appearance of fair-faced concrete (FFC). The mainly surface chromatic aberration identification (CAI) method being applied is manual observation, which is subjective and time-consuming. A multi-scale lightweight structured data algorithm (MSLSDA) for CAI in FFC is proposed in this manuscript. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used for image acquisition. 2368 FFC sample images are collected to build the datasets. The FFC chromatic aberration features are identified by the improved Residual Network Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework to achieve chromatic aberration samples quantitative analysis. The method proposed in this manuscript can verify the generalization prediction ability of the MSLSDA for different building samples by generalization prediction set. The results show that the accuracy in CAI samples and chromatic aberration generalization prediction samples can achieve 92.1 and 99.6%, respectively. The FFC chromatic aberration detection platform (FFC-CADP) built by color space conversion, histogram equalization, image color recognition, image noise reduction and image mask algorithm is able to calculate boundary features, geometric parameter features (length and width), chromatic aberration ratio features, total chromatic aberration ratio and number of chromatic aberration.

AB  - One of the key components of this research has been the mapping of Antarctic bed topography and ice thickness parameters that are crucial for modelling ice flow and hence for predicting future ice loss and the ensuing sea level rise. Supported by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), the Bedmap3 Action Group aims not only to produce new gridded maps of ice thickness and bed topography for the international scientific community, but also to standardize and make available all the geophysical survey data points used in producing the Bedmap gridded products. Here, we document the survey data used in the latest iteration, Bedmap3, incorporating and adding to all of the datasets previously used for Bedmap1 and Bedmap2, including ice bed, surface and thickness point data from all Antarctic geophysical campaigns since the 1950s. More specifically, we describe the processes used to standardize and make these and future surveys and gridded datasets accessible under the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. With the goals of making the gridding process reproducible and allowing scientists to re-use the data freely for their own analysis, we introduce the new SCAR Bedmap Data Portal (https://bedmap.scar.org, last access: 1 March 2023) created to provide unprecedented open access to these important datasets through a web-map interface. We believe that this data release will be a valuable asset to Antarctic research and will greatly extend the life cycle of the data held within it. Data are available from the UK Polar Data Centre: https://data.bas.ac.uk (last access: 5 May 2023 ). See the Data availability section for the complete list of datasets.

AB  - The proliferation of electronic health records, driven by advances in technology and legislative measures, is stimulating interest in the analysis of passively collected administrative and clinical data. Observational data present exciting challenges and opportunities to researchers interested in comparing the effectiveness of different treatment regimes and, as personalized medicine requires, estimating how effectiveness varies among subgroups. In this study, we provide new motivation for the local control approach to the analysis of large observational datasets in which patients are first clustered in pretreatment covariate space and treatment comparisons are made within subgroups of similar patients. The motivation for such an analysis is that the resulting local treatment effect estimates make inherently fair comparisons even when treatment cohorts suffer variation in balance (treatment choice fraction) across pretreatment covariate space. We use an example of Simpson's paradox to show that estimates of the overall average treatment effect, which marginalize over covariate space, can be misleading. Thus, we provide an alternative definition that uses a single, shared marginal distribution to define overall treatment comparisons that are inherently fair given the observed covariates. However, we also argue that overall treatment comparisons should no longer be the focus of comparative effectiveness research; the possibility that treatment effectiveness does vary across patient subpopulations must not be left unexplored. In the spirit of the now ubiquitous concept of personalized medicine, estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in clinically relevant subgroups will allow for, within the limits of the available data, fair treatment comparisons that are more relevant to individual patients.

AB  - A multi-party fair exchange protocol is a cryptographic protocol allowing several parties to exchange commodities in such a way that everyone gives an item away if and only if it receives an item in return. In this paper we discuss a multi-party fair exchange protocol originally proposed by Franklin and Tsudik, and subsequently shown to have flaws and fixed by Gonzalez and Markowitch. We identify flaws in the fixed version of the protocol, propose a corrected version, and give a formal proof of correctness in the strand space model.

TI  - "Be sustainable": EOSC-Life recommendations for implementation of FAIR principles in life science data handling

KW  - MODEL
AB  - The main goals and challenges for the life science communities in the Open Science framework are to increase reuse and sustainability of data resources, software tools, and workflows, especially in large-scale data-driven research and computational analyses. Here, we present key findings, procedures, effective measures and recommendations for generating and establishing sustainable life science resources based on the collaborative, cross-disciplinary work done within the EOSC-Life (European Open Science Cloud for Life Sciences) consortium. Bringing together 13 European life science research infrastructures, it has laid the foundation for an open, digital space to support biological and medical research. Using lessons learned from 27 selected projects, we describe the organisational, technical, financial and legal/ethical challenges that represent the main barriers to sustainability in the life sciences. We show how EOSC-Life provides a model for sustainable data management according to FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles, including solutions for sensitive- and industry-related resources, by means of cross-disciplinary training and best practices sharing. Finally, we illustrate how data harmonisation and collaborative work facilitate interoperability of tools, data, solutions and lead to a better understanding of concepts, semantics and functionalities in the life sciences.

AB  - In this perspective article, we consider the critical issue of data and other research object standardisation and, specifically, how international collaboration, and organizations such as the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) can encourage that emerging neuroscience data be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). As neuroscientists engaged in the sharing and integration of multi-modal and multiscale data, we see the current insufficiency of standards as a major impediment in the Interoperability and Reusability of research results. We call for increased international collaborative standardisation of neuroscience data to foster integration and efficient reuse of research objects.

AB  - This paper analyzed the competitiveness of premium and regular Fair Trade and Organic (FTO) coffees relative to conventional coffee using consumer panel data. The coffees were categorized into four groups based on their certification labels and prices: Premium or Regular Conventional, and Premium or Regular FTO. Competitiveness was measured in terms of price sensitivity and substitution behavior in the entire market and in segments of core consumers who spent most of their coffee budgets on FTO coffees. We found that most consumers were more likely to substitute both FTO products for conventional products, and less likely to substitute out of conventional products. Even the core consumers of Premium FTO coffees, who had inelastic demand for that type of coffee, were more likely to switch to Regular Conventional coffees than to Regular FTO coffees, even though both alternatives were similarly low-priced. The results suggest that even core FTO market segments were not strongly committed to certified products. Companies making and selling certified products need to do more beyond matching prices and using sustainability certification labels to increase their market competitiveness and potential options are discussed in this paper.

AB  - Background: Mental health disparities persistently cause inequity and social exclusion. Extensive research underpins the need to embrace the social determinants of health and facilitate network learning at various ecosystem levels. Despite valuable quality frameworks and ratified conventions, local practices which counter health inequity are scarce.Methods: The Dutch HOP-TR study collected health and needs of Homeless Service Users (HSU) in a rights-based, transdiagnostic, recovery framework. We assessed the survival modes and conducted a socio-ecological analysis, exploring what happened in care pathways at three ecosystem levels: individual HSU, caregiver networks, society. While documenting vital conditions for growth and citizenship, we explore major opportunities to develop 'fair space for life'.Results: Under low distress levels, prosocial behavior is prominent (32.9%). High distress levels are found with an avoidant (42.0%) or aggressive mode (24.9%). Rising distress levels give more frictions in relations, psychiatric admissions, and police-justice contacts. The distress-induced descent in the social hierarchy causes social withdrawal, alienation, and marginalization. At society level, fair conditions for growth and citizenship are challenged by the cumulative impact of distress over the HSU' lives.Discussion: This care monitor uncovers the impact of distress on caregiver interactions. The care pathways reveal that the survival strategies reflect a systematic, pervasive neglect. Unfair representations hold HSU personally responsible of their situation, disregarding the cumulative impact of environmental conditions over their lives. The diverse sources of unfairness are intrinsic to the health care system and culture. Therefore, the survival modes ask for profound culture transformations in a whole-system-whole-society approach.Conclusion: Given the need for action on health equity and the social determinants of health, this paper provides an example of a dynamic care monitor. The actionable data elicit dialogs and stimulate to enrich opportunities for inclusion and growth in communities and societies.

AB  - Fair weather atmospheric electric field has been studied at Darjeeling (latitude 27 degrees 01'N longitude 88 degrees 36'E, 2200 masl), a high altitude station in eastern Himalayas and compared with the Carnegie curve. The potential gradient (PG) measured is larger than Carnegie curve for most of the time of the day. In order to understand the effect of the local components we have studied the PG variation along with the meteorological parameters and atmospheric constituents such as mixed layer depth, potential temperature, PM2.5, black carbon (BC), aerosol optical depth (AOD), integrated water vapour and liquid water. The local components like PM2.5 and BC show a good correlation with PG. On the other hand Columnar quantities like AOD as well as integrated water vapour and liquid water shows negative correlation with PG which could be associated with the higher mobile negative charges and the complex behavior of space charges. The periodogram of fair weather PG data shows one half day, one day and 100 days periodicity, the power being maximum for one day period. A comparison with other observations shows the presence of larger number of peaks in summer. Morning and evening PG are in general lower compared to the other sites.

AB  - In this paper, we solve the motion smoothing problem using genetic algorithms. Smooth motion generation is essential in the computer animation and virtual reality area. The motion of a rigid body in general consists of translation and orientation. The former is described by a space curve in three-dimensional Euclidean space while the latter is represented by a curve in the unit quaternion space. By adopting the geometric approach, the smoothness of both translation data and orientation data is measured from the strain energy perspective and a nonlinear optimization problem is formulated that aims to minimize the weighted sum of the strain-energy and the sum of the squared errors. A hybrid algorithm that combines genetic algorithms and local search schemes is deployed to solve this optimization problem and the experiments show that both smoothness and shape preservation of the resulting motion can be achieved by the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Neural operators can learn nonlinear mappings between function spaces and offer a new simulation paradigm for real-time prediction of complex dynamics for realistic diverse applications as well as for system identification in science and engineering. Herein, we investigate the performance of two neural operators, which have shown promising results so far, and we develop new practical extensions that will make them more accurate and robust and importantly more suitable for industrial-complexity applications. The first neural operator, DeepONet, was published in 2019 (Lu et al., 2019), and its original architecture was based on the universal approximation theorem of Chen & Chen (1995). The second one, named Fourier Neural Operator or FNO, was published in 2020 (Li et al., 2020), and it is based on parameterizing the integral kernel in the Fourier space. DeepONet is represented by a summation of products of neural networks (NNs), corresponding to the branch NN for the input function and the trunk NN for the output function; both NNs are general architectures, e.g., the branch NN can be replaced with a CNN or a ResNet. According to Kovachki et al. (2021), FNO in its continuous form can be viewed conceptually as a DeepONet with a specific architecture of the branch NN and a trunk NN represented by a trigonometric basis. In order to compare FNO with DeepONet computationally for realistic setups, we develop several extensions of FNO that can deal with complex geometric domains as well as mappings where the input and output function spaces are of different dimensions. We also develop an extended DeepONet with special features that provide inductive bias and accelerate training, and we present a faster implementation of DeepONet with cost comparable to the computational cost of FNO, which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform. We consider 16 different benchmarks to demonstrate the relative performance of the two neural operators, including instability wave analysis in hypersonic boundary layers, prediction of the vorticity field of a flapping airfoil, porous media simulations in complex-geometry domains, etc. We follow the guiding principles of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) for scientific data management and stewardship. The performance of DeepONet and FNO is comparable for relatively simple settings, but for complex geometries the performance of FNO deteriorates greatly. We also

AB  - Institutions driving fundamental research at the cutting edge such as for example from the Max Planck Society (MPS) took steps to optimize data management and stewardship to be able to address new scientific questions. In this paper we selected three institutes from the MPS from the areas of humanities, environmental sciences and natural sciences as examples to indicate the efforts to integrate large amounts of data from collaborators worldwide to create a data space that is ready to be exploited to get new insights based on data intensive science methods. For this integration the typical challenges of fragmentation, bad quality and also social differences had to be overcome. In all three cases, well-managed repositories that are driven by the scientific needs and harmonization principles that have been agreed upon in the community were the core pillars. It is not surprising that these principles are very much aligned with what have now become the FAIR principles. The FAIR principles confirm the correctness of earlier decisions and their clear formulation identified the gaps which the projects need to address.

AB  - This paper documents a recent R&D effort conducted by the Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate, to assess the feasibility of fabricating large composite launch vehicle fairings without the use of autoclaves. Two composite manufacturing approaches were demonstrated: vacuum-bag compaction with oven cure and vacuum assisted resin transfer molding with oven cure. For this project, a 2.8-m diameter fairing was developed for the Minotaur IV launch system. The prototype fairing was instrumented and tested up to qualification test loads. No damage or permanent deformations were observed. Measured strain and displacement data were compared to model predictions; trends and amplitudes were generally in agreement.

AB  - Analysis of the variation of the potential gradient (PG) at ground level is important to monitor the global electric circuit and the different solar and geophysical phenomena affecting it. However, this is challenging since several local factors (e.g., meteorological) produce perturbations in the potential gradient. Time series and spectral analysis of PG at several stations can help to minimise local effects so that global effects may be more clearly observed. In this work, for the first time we performed spectral analysis of the potential gradient recorded at several sites located at Vostok, Concordia, Halley and Casleo (Southern Hemisphere), and Sodankyla and Reading (Northern Hemisphere). In order to find the main periodicities and how the amplitude of those periods change as a function of time we use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and the wavelet transform, respectively. For all PG sites we found periodicities of 0.5-, 1-, -180- and 365-day. Our results show that the 0.5-day (1-day) periodicity is more prominent during the months of June-July-August (December-January-February). Evidence of -27- and - 45-day periods was also observed at multiple sites. Further analysis using the cross-wavelet transform for PG versus cosmic rays, PG versus Madden-Julian Oscillation index, and PG versus meteorological parameters, show clues that the 27- and 45-day periods are likely related to the solar rotation and MaddenJulian Oscillation, respectively. Furthermore, our results show that during the passages of co-rotating interaction regions, the 27-day period for PG vs cosmic rays XWT is stronger than for the other XWT analysis.

AB  - Despite an ever-growing number of data sets that catalog and characterize interactions between microbes in different environments and conditions, many of these data are neither easily accessible nor intercompatible. These limitations present a major challenge to microbiome research by hindering the streamlined drawing of inferences across studies. Here, we propose guiding principles to make microbial interaction data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). We outline specific use cases for interaction data that span the diverse space of microbiome research, and discuss the untapped potential for new insights that can be fulfilled through broader integration of microbial interaction data. These include, among others, the design of intercompatible synthetic communities for environmental, industrial, or medical applications, and the inference of novel interactions from disparate studies. Lastly, we envision potential trajectories for the deployment of FAIR microbial interaction data based on existing resources, reporting standards, and current momentum within the community.

AB  - This paper analyzes how fairs held in Liberdade Square between 1969 and 1991 became a public issue, which demanded state action for the reallocation of these events by the municipal administration of Belo Horizonte. It's analyzed how narratives were built at the time by the agents involved: media, academia, public authorities, vendors, and attendees. Journalistic materials and academic and literary works about the square were used as data sources. The analysis of the speeches about the fairs reveals that they were denounced as an appropriation that damaged natural and architectural heritage. The media played a major role in publicizing the problem. In their argumentative constructions, the media, public authorities, and intellectuals acted as moral entrepreneurs, framing the fairs and their consumers as an irreconcilable appropriation with spaces of symbolic value and power such as Liberdade Square.

KW  - Limited labeled data
AB  - Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in high-stakes applications impacting society. Therefore, it is of critical importance that ML models do not propagate discrimination. Collecting accurate labeled data in societal applications is challenging and costly. Active learning is a promising approach to build an accurate classifier by interactively querying an oracle within a labeling budget. We introduce the fair active learning framework to carefully select data points to be labeled so as to balance model accuracy and fairness. To incorporate the notion of fairness in the active learning sampling core, it is required to measure the fairness of the model after adding each unlabeled sample. Since their labels are unknown in advance, we propose an expected fairness metric to probabilistically measure the impact of each sample if added for each possible class label. Next, we propose multiple optimizations to balance the trade-off between accuracy and fairness. Our first optimization linearly aggregate the expected fairness with entropy using a control parameter. To avoid erroneous estimation of the expected fairness, we propose a nested approach to maintain the accuracy of the model, limiting the search space to the top bucket of sample points with large entropy. Finally, to ensure the unfairness reduction of the model after labeling, we propose to replicate the points that truly reduce the unfairness after labeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms over widely used benchmark datasets using demographic parity and equalized odds notions of fairness.

TI  - An iterative and interdisciplinary categorisation process towards FAIRer digital resources for sensitive life-sciences data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - For life science infrastructures, sensitive data generate an additional layer of complexity. Cross-domain categorisation and discovery of digital resources related to sensitive data presents major interoperability challenges. To support this FAIRification process, a toolbox demonstrator aiming at support for discovery of digital objects related to sensitive data (e.g., regulations, guidelines, best practice, tools) has been developed. The toolbox is based upon a categorisation system developed and harmonised across a cluster of 6 life science research infrastructures. Three different versions were built, tested by subsequent pilot studies, finally leading to a system with 7 main categories (sensitive data type, resource type, research field, data type, stage in data sharing life cycle, geographical scope, specific topics). 109 resources attached with the tags in pilot study 3 were used as the initial content for the toolbox demonstrator, a software tool allowing searching of digital objects linked to sensitive data with filtering based upon the categorisation system. Important next steps are a broad evaluation of the usability and user-friendliness of the toolbox, extension to more resources, broader adoption by different life-science communities, and a long-term vision for maintenance and sustainability.

AB  - The application of overset grids to the computational fluid dynamics analysis of three-dimensional internal flow in the payload/fairing of an expendable launch vehicle is described. In conjunction with the overset grid system, the flowfield in the payload/fairing configuration is obtained with the aid of OVERFLOW Navier-Stokes code. The solution exhibits a highly three-dimensional complex flowfield with swirl, separation, and vortices. Some of the computed flow features are compared with the measured Laser-Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) data on a 1/5th scale model of the payload/fairing configuration. The counter-rotating vortex structures and the location of the saddle point predicted by the CFD analysis are in general agreement with the LDV data. Comparisons of the computed (CFD) velocity profiles on horizontal and vertical lines in the LDV measurement plane in the faring nose region show reasonable agreement with the LDV data.

AB  - Natural lightning and the associated clouds are known to behave differently over land and ocean, but many questions remain. We expand the related observational datasets by obtaining simultaneous quasi-static electric field observations over coastal land, near-shore water, and deep ocean regions during both fair-weather and thunderstorm periods. Oceanic observations were obtained using two 3-m NOAA buoys that were instrumented with Campbell Scientific electric field mills to measure the quasi-static electric fields. These data were compared to selected electric field records from the existing on-shore electric field mill suite of 31 sensors at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Lightning occurrence times, locations and peak current estimates for both onshore and ocean were provided by the U.S. National Lightning Detection Network. The buoy instruments were first evaluated on-shore at the Florida coast, and the first system was calibrated for field enhancements and to confirm proper behavior of the system in elevated-field environments. The buoys were then moored 20 mi and 120 mi off the coast of KSC in February (20 mi) and August (120 mi) 2014. Diurnal fair-weather fields at both ocean sites matched will with each other and with those found during the Carnegie cruise, but mean values were 33% smaller, due at least inpart to constraints on the calibration procedure. Diurnal fair-weather fields variations at coastal and inland sites were a poorer match than offshore, likely because the offshore environment is "cleaner" with limited variations in local space charge, lower surface aerosol densities, little surface heating to disturb the surface charge layer during fair weather, and fewer local radioactive sources to modulate the near-surface electrical conductivity. Storm-related static fields were 4-5x larger at both oceanic sites than over land, likely due to decreased screening by near-surface space charge produced by corona current. The time-evolution of the electric field and field changes during storm approach are sufficiently different over land and ocean to warrant further study. This work shows the quality, accuracy, and reliability of these data, and has demonstrated the practicality of off-shore electric field measurements for safety- and launch-related decision making at KSC.

AB  - This note suggests that decimal latitude/longitude [dLL] locations should be used to identify features of interest, landforms, sample and investigations sites, in an 'information landscape' provided by the geomorphological literature. All the information associated with a labelled, or tagged, geolocation should be available for examination as part of information landscapes that can be explored and represented in books, papers and other publications. This note also outlines the 'open' and FAIR data that are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and how the principles can be used to better explain landscapes, especially in the mountain landscape domain. Tors and rock glaciers illustrate [dLL] geolocation to identify sites and inform fieldwork and literature searching. Any [dLL]-specified location is an identifying label, as are names given to landforms and toponyms. Two letters (digraph) are used as landform labels: TO for tors and RG for rock glaciers. Citations, (author-date-title-source) attributions, are also labels. The note shows how these attributions can be linked to [dLL] geolocations specifying locations in time and space and in the literature. The addition of [dLL] will facilitate future literature searches and modelling to explore 'unknowns' in the landscape, and this paper suggests ways in which this can be achieved, including geoheritage and geotourism.

AB  - As digital data circulation increases, information pollution and manipulation in journalism have become more prevalent. In this study, a new digital journalism model is designed to contribute to the solution of the main current problems, such as information pollution, manipulation, and account-ability in digital journalism. The model uses blockchain technology due to its transparency, immutability, and traceability. However, it is tough to provide the mechanisms necessary for journalism, such as updating one piece of information, instantly updating all other information affected by the updated information, establishing logical relationships between news, making quick comparisons, sorting and indexing news, and keeping the changing informa-tion about the news in the system, with the blockchain data structure. For this reason, in our study, we have developed a new data structure that provides both the immutability, transparency and traceability properties of the blockchain and can support the communication mechanisms necessary for journalism. The functionality of our proposed data structure is demonstrated in terms of communication mechanisms such as mutability, context, consistency, and reliability through example scenarios. Additionally, our data structure is compared with the data structure of blockchain technology in terms of time, space, and maintenance costs. Accordingly, while the model size increases linearly in blockchain, the model's size remains approximately constant since the structure we developed is data-independent. In this way, maintenance costs are reduced. Since our model also has an indexing mechanism, it reduces the linear time search complexity to logarithmic time. As a result, the data structure we developed is found to have higher performance than blockchain in the journalism concept. In future studies, it is planned to test all aspects of the model with a pilot application, eliminate its shortcomings, and develop a holistic approach to the root causes of the problems in the journalism focus.

AB  - The continuing drive towards digitization in manufacturing leads to an increasing number of digital twins for monitoring and controlling all kinds of processes. While these capture crucial data of all individual steps and allow for analysis and optimization, more often than not the underlying models are confined to individual systems or organizations. This hinders data exchange, especially across institutional borders and thus represents an important barrier for economic success. Similar challenges in the scientific community led to the emergence of the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) as guidelines towards a sustainable data landscape. Despite the growing presence within academia, their transfer to industry has not yet received similar attention. We argue that the existing efforts and experiences in science can be exploited to address current data management challenges in industry as well. An improved data exchange within organizations and beyond can not just lower costs, but also opens up new opportunities ranging from discovering new suppliers or partners to improving existing value chains.

AB  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) achieve high accuracy in various cognitive tasks (i.e., inferences), but often fail to meet power and latency budgets due to intensive computational overheads. To address the challenge, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as high-performance and power-efficient alternatives thanks to their theoretically efficient spike-driven computations. The spike-based computations have a high potential of achieving cost-effective inferencing with their low-precision data representations, simple neuron operations, and new parallelization opportunities. To determine which network (i.e., ANN or SNN) is suitable for which purposes, it is essential to accurately evaluate the costeffectiveness of an SNN and compare it to the corresponding ANN. However, existing studies overestimate or underestimate the cost-effectiveness of SNNs over ANNs as they consider only the limited design points and compare SNNs against naive ANN hardware baselines. In this study, we propose a full-stack SNN evaluation methodology to accurately evaluate the costeffectiveness of SNNs. Quantifying the potential of SNNs is highly challenging as the evaluations require full-stack knowledge on SNNs' unique computational features and how each affects the mechanisms of the underlying hardware. For this purpose, we identify five representative SNN-specific design points that affect hardware performance and demonstrate the impact of each design point with the quantified experimental results. Next, we modify the existing ANN accelerator to support the identified SNN-specific design points and implement a cycle-accurate simulator to evaluate how each point affects the overall cost-effectiveness. As a case study, we evaluate SNNs converted from pretrained ANNs and compare them against the ANN counterparts using our simulator. Our study is the first work to accurately evaluate the cost-effectiveness of SNNs and make fair comparisons against ANNs. In addition, our methodology provides important guidelines for the next-generation SNN accelerator designs. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sources of differences between observations and simulations for a case study using the Noah land surface model-based High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS) are examined for sensible and latent heat fluxes H and LE, respectively; surface temperature T-s; and vertical temperature difference T-0 - T-s, where T-0 is at 2 m. The observational data were collected on 29 May 2002, using the University of Wyoming King Air and four surface towers placed along a sparsely vegetated 60-km north-south flight track in the Oklahoma Panhandle. This day had nearly clear skies and a strong north-south soil-moisture gradient, with wet soils and widespread puddles at the south end of the track and drier soils to the north. Relative amplitudes of H and LE horizontal variation were estimated by taking the slope of the least squares best-fit straight line Delta LE/Delta H on plots of time-averaged LE as a function of time-averaged H for values along the track. It is argued that observed H and LE values departing significantly from their slope line are not associated with surface processes and, hence, need not be replicated by HRLDAS. Reasonable agreement between HRLDAS results and observed data was found only after adjusting the coefficient C in the Zilitinkevich equation relating the roughness lengths for momentum and heat in HRLDAS from its default value of 0.1 to a new value of 0.5. Using C = 0.1 and adjusting soil moisture to match the observed near-surface values increased horizontal variability in the right sense, raising LE and lowering H over the moist south end. However, both the magnitude of H and the amplitude of its horizontal variability relative to LE remained too large; adjustment of the green vegetation fraction had only a minor effect. With C = 0.5, model-input green vegetation fraction, and our best-estimate soil moisture, H, LE, Delta LE/Delta H, and T-0 - T-s, were all close to observed values. The remaining inconsistency between model and observations - too high a value of H and too low a value of LE over the wet southern end of the track - could be due to HRLDAS ignoring the effect of open water. Neglecting the effect of moist soils on the albedo could also have contributed.

AB  - With the purpose of understanding the variation of fair-weather atmospheric electric field, the vertical component of atmospheric electric field (recorded as Ez) has been measured in the town Binchuan (25 degrees 50 ' N, 100 degrees 34 ' E, 1438.7 m asl) of Dali city, Yunnan, China from June 14, 2017 to December 1, 2020. Automatic measured visual range is used as a proxy of aerosol concentration. The mean diurnal variation curve of the fair-weather Ez in Binchuan, having two peaks occurred at around 9LT and 20LT, shows little correlation with the well-known Carnegie Curve and other two high-latitude sites' Curves. While strong negative correlation between fair-weather Ez and visual range is found, indicating the variation of fair-weather is dominated by aerosol concentration. The main source of aerosol concentration variation probably sunrise and sunset effect. We support our findings by comparing Ez, visual range with sunrise and sunset times. The peaks (troughs) of Ez (visual range) are proved to have weak correlations with anthropogenic pollution through comparing the Ez, visual range under workdays and holidays.

AB  - Maintaining enough green areas and ensuring fair access to them is a common planning challenge in growing and densifying cities. Evaluations of green area access typically use metrics like population around green areas (within a certain buffer), but these do not fully ensure equitable access. We propose that using systematic and complementarity-driven spatial prioritization, often used in nature conservation planning, could assist in the complex planning challenge. Here, we demonstrate the use of spatial prioritization to identify green areas with highest recreational potential based on their type and their accessibility for the residents of the Helsinki Metropolitan area, the capital district of Finland. We calculated travel times from each city district to each green area. Travel times were calculated separately to local green areas using active travel modes (walking and biking), and to large forests (attracting people from near and far) using public transport. We prioritized the green areas using these multimodal travel times from each district and weighting the prioritization with population data with Zonation, conservation prioritization software. Compared to a typical buffer analysis (population within a 500 m buffer from green areas), our approach identified areas of high recreational potential in different parts of the study area. This approach allows systematic integration of travel-time-based accessibility measures into equitable spatial prioritization of recreational green areas. It can help urban planners to identify sets of green areas that best support the recreational needs of the residents across the city.

AB  - Pervasiveness of tracking devices and enhanced availability of spatially located data has deepened interest in using them for various policy interventions, through computational data analysis tasks such as spatial hot spot detection. In this paper, we consider, for the first time to our best knowledge, fairness in detecting spatial hot spots. We motivate the need for ensuring fairness through statistical parity over the collective population covered across chosen hot spots. We then characterize the task of identifying a diverse set of solutions in the noteworthiness-fairness trade-off spectrum, to empower the user to choose a trade-off justified by the policy domain. Being a novel task formulation, we also develop a suite of evaluation metrics for fair hot spots, motivated by the need to evaluate pertinent aspects of the task. We illustrate the computational infeasibility of identifying fair hot spots using naive and/or direct approaches and devise a method, codenamed FiSH, for efficiently identifying high-quality, fair and diverse sets of spatial hot spots. FiSH traverses the tree-structured search space using heuristics that guide it towards identifying noteworthy and fair sets of spatial hot spots. Through an extensive empirical analysis over a real-world dataset from the domain of human development, we illustrate that FiSH generates high-quality solutions at fast response times. Towards assessing the relevance of FiSH in real-world context, we also provide a detailed discussion of how it could fit within the current practice of hot spots policing, as read within the historical context of the evolution of the practice.

AB  - SATech-01 is an experimental satellite for space science exploration and on -orbit demonstration of advanced technologies. The satellite is equipped with 16 experimental payloads and supports multiple working modes to meet the observation requirements of various payloads. Due to the limitation of platform power supply and data storage systems, proposing reasonable mission planning schemes to improve scientific revenue of the payloads becomes a critical issue. In this article, we formulate the integrated task scheduling of SATech-01 as a multi -objective optimization problem and propose a novel Fair Integrated Scheduling with Proximal Policy Optimization (FIS-PPO) algorithm to solve it. We use multiple decision heads to generate decisions for each task and design the action mask to ensure the schedule meeting the platform constraints. Experimental results show that FIS-PPO could push the capability of the platform to the limit and improve the overall observation efficiency by 31.5% compared to rule -based plans currently used. Moreover, fairness is considered in the reward design and our method achieves much better performance in terms of equal task opportunities. Because of its low computational complexity, our task scheduling algorithm has the potential to be directly deployed on board for real-time task scheduling in future space projects.

AB  - The global atmospheric electric circuit, which links the space environment with terrestrial weather, has mostly been investigated using fair-weather surface atmospheric electricity measurements. Retrieving global circuit information, however, requires the selection of "fair weather" data, to avoid local meteorological disturbances. The research results presented here challenge the applicability of long-standing definitions of electrically fair weather atmospheric conditions. From detailed new measurements and theory, three improved requirements (FW1 to FW3) for fair weather atmospheric electricity conditions are described. These are: (FW1) absence of hydrometeors, aerosol and haze, as apparent through the visual range exceeding 2 km, (FW2) negligible cumuliform cloud and no extensive stratus cloud with cloud base below 1500 m, and (FW3) surface wind speed between 1 m s(-1) and 8 m s(-1). Automatic and manual measurement approaches to identifying these requirements are given. Through applying these criteria at the many measurements sites now operating, the noise from meteorological variability will be reduced, leading to data more representative of the global electric circuit.

AB  - The high intensity and high energy antiproton beams which will be produced at FAIR open the possibility to determine time-like electromagnetic form factors in a wide kinematical range, through the annihilation reaction: p+(p) over bar -> e(+)e(-). The status of the proposed experiment as well as the expected results are presented on the basis of realistic simulations. The impact of these measurements on the understanding of the nucleon structure, of the asymptotic properties of form factors and of the reaction mechanism are discussed using model independent statements based on symmetry properties of the strong and electromagnetic interactions in connection with space-like data.

AB  - Despite the shortened commodity chain created for coffee through fair trade, there still exist a number of actors within certified commodity exchange. This chain is populated by disproportionately engaged actors, from a consumer looking for the certification seal, to coffee roasters working directly with coffee producing cooperatives, to producers striving to keep up with the standards for certification. Despite such disparities, connections are made between the roasters and the growers of coffee at multiple sites, from community-based projects to the transfer of knowledge and storytelling beyond the communities where coffee is cultivated. These connections suggest that fair trade exchanges potentially go beyond the sale of a commodity, the creation of surplus value and the connecting of producer and consumer. In this paper, I draw on the expanding literature on diverse and community economies to examine fair trade exchanges. The heterogeneous space of the community economy provides a platform for considering the diversity of exchanges happening within, outside, and alongside capitalism. In this paper, I focus on fair trade certified coffee, moving beyond current explanations of fair trade as alternative and working toward a multiplying of our understanding(s) of what fair trade is. Utilizing data collected in Chiapas, Mexico with two coffee producing cooperatives and their U.S.-based partner roasters, as well as analysis of the, 2016 celebration of Fair Trade Month, I reframe fair trade to examine the power and privilege in certified exchanges and consider the broader fair trade network as a site of community economies.

AB  - To stimulate sales of sustainable products, such as organic and fair trade products, retailers need to know whether their in-store instruments effectively enhance market shares. This study uses sales data and a multilevel modeling approach to explain the market shares of sustainable products according to shelf layout factors, price level, price promotions, and consumer demographics. It argues that the effect of these variables differs between organic versus fair trade products, as buying motives might differ, organic buyers tend to be more loyal, and price is a more informative signal of quality for organic products. Results show that the number of facings has a positive relationship with the market share of fair trade brands, but not with the market share of organic brands. The same holds for the price difference with the leading brand, which is important for fair trade brands but not for organic brands. In contrast, an arrangement of the product category by brand is associated with higher market share for organic brands but not for fair trade brands. Additionally, placement at eye level and clustering of items benefits both types of sustainable brands, whereas they appear to be not very sensitive to price promotions. Finally, higher sales of sustainable products are found in areas where the customer base is older and has a higher education level.

AB  - In recent years, the issue of fairness has become important in the field of machine learning. In clustering problems, fairness is defined in terms of consistency in that the balance ratio of data with different sensitive attribute values remains constant for each cluster. Fairness problems are important in real-world applications, for example, when the recommendation system provides targeted advertisements or job offers based on the clustering result of candidates, the minority group may not get the same level of opportunity as the majority group if the clustering result is unfair. In this study, we propose a novel distribution-based fair clustering approach. Considering a distribution in which the sample is biased by society, we try to find clusters from a fair correspondence distribution. Our method uses the support vector method and a dynamical system to comprehensively divide the entire data space into atomic cells before reassembling them fairly to form the clusters. Theoretical results derive the upper bound of the generalization error of the corresponding clustering function in the fair correspondence distribution when atomic cells are connected fairly, allowing us to present an algorithm to achieve fairness. Experimental results show that our algorithm beneficially increases fairness while reducing computation time for various datasets. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Systematic analysis of the Surface fair-weather potential gradient (PG) measured for 13 months (July 2005-July 2006) at 10 s resolution over a small tropical island station Suva (18.08 degrees S, 178.45 degrees E), Fiji is presented. Based oil the solar radiation (>800 W m(-2)) and surface wind speed (<4.5 m s(-1)) conditions, 63 fair-weather days were selected. After sorting the data into a range of 0-1000 V m(-1), the average PG was similar to 139 V m(-1). The measured fair-weather PG had a semi-diurnal structure, with a more pronounced peak at 0730 LT (1930 UT) and a reduced peak at 2200 LT (1000 UT). The time of occurrence of the morning peak and the noontime minima agreed well with the Carnegie curve. However, the variation about the global mean in the measured PG was 150% whereas for the Carnegie Curve it was only 35%. The effects of the local meteorological parameters on the PG measurements were found to be small. Oil average, the PG during the dry season (May-October) was always greater than in the wet season (November-April). In contrast, analysis of regional (0-60 degrees S and 100 degrees E-160 degrees W) lightning activity on fair-weather days showed a peak at similar to 2000 LT and higher lightning activity during the wet season. These results indicate that the regional thunderstorm activity has no direct connection with the local fair-weather PG at the site.

AB  - Through a study of trade fairs, this article illustrates that relational approaches to economic geography are not limited to the sphere of economic and social relationships. These relationships are influenced by and, in turn, shape material realities, such as specific infrastructure and the labour market, in a reflexive manner. Trade fairs are relational events that bring together regional, national, and often international producers, users, suppliers, and other agents of a value chain or technology field for the purpose of exchanging knowledge about technological and market developments, building partnerships, and maintaining existing networks through learning by interaction and observation. However, these events are also situated in space and time, grounded in the contexts of particular industries, trade patterns, public and private investments, as well as the economic geographies of places. Focusing on North America, this article presents and analyzes data on the economic geography of trade fairs and their regional economic impact (number of events, exhibitors, attendees, exhibition space). It explores regional trade fair patterns and dynamic changes in major trade fair cities by emphasizing the role of history and industry context.

AB  - Interior fairing noise is an important consideration for payload launch survivability and has been studied extensively since the beginning of the space program. This work presents acoustic transmission studies conducted by the Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate, on a composite, grid-stiffened, Minotaur payload fairing. These tests were performed in an acoustics laboratory and examined the effects of acoustic flanking paths, the thermal protection system, and melamine-type acoustic blanket treatments on fairing noise. The data showed that acoustic flanking paths significantly increase noise transmission, especially at low frequency. The bare fairing with thermal protection system provided approximately 14 dB of noise reduction over the 5000 Hz bandwidth relative to external levels. Acoustic blanket performance was measured as a function of bandwidth, surface area coverage, and mass. It was observed that small amounts of treatment (2 kg) significantly increased noise reduction (3.6 dB), even at low frequency.

AB  - This paper proposes applying Walsh-Hadamard transform spreading (WHTS) in conjunction with space-division multiple access (SDMA) in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system to provide enhanced multi-user downlink capability in visible light communication (VLC) scenarios. VLC environments are characterized by strong interference from the emissions of adjacent lamps. Thus, SDMA-OFDM schemes can be applied to enable multi-user capability while ensuring a highly efficient use of the limited available bandwidth. However, these SDMA-OFDM systems can only provide multiple access for a small number of users whenever there is enough channel diversity to separate the users' information. This is the case, for example, when each single user is associated with a specific emitting lamp and angle-diversity receiving techniques are applied. However, to accommodate a greater number of users requires a user's distribution in the frequency domain. In this sense, the proposed Walsh-Hadamard transform spreading scheme provides a fair assignment of the available subcarriers among the different users leading to an identical throughput and bit error rate (BER) for users allocated to the same emitting lamp. This BER is also controllable by means of an adaptive throughput mechanism. The numerical results show that the proposed adaptive WHTS-assisted SDMA-OFDM system in a full-user scenario presents a similar performance to that of an adaptive SDMA-OFDM system irrespective of the number of users per lamp, while providing enhanced multi-user capability. Finally, an adaptive algorithm for resource allocation is evaluated, demonstrating a high degree of satisfaction (regarding demanded data rates) when large numbers of users are simultaneously served.

AB  - Recently, in the field of fair machine learning, a large number of studies have considered how to remove discriminatory information from the data and achieve fairness in downstream tasks. Fair representation learning considers removing sensitive information (e.g. race, gender, etc) in the latent space, and the learned representations can prevent machine learning systems from being biased by discriminatory information. In this paper, we study the problems of existing methods and propose a novel fair representation learning method for the fair transfer learning where the labels of the downstream tasks are unknown. Specifically, we bring a new training model with information-theoretically motivated objective which avoids the problem of alignment for learning disentangled fair representations. Empirical results in various settings demonstrate the broad applicability and utility of our approach.

AB  - Fairs often speak about the people and their embedded place. As an expressive space, fair mirrors the culture of the community and the emotional bond. The study unravels the fairs of West Bengal, an eastern state of India by exploring the physicality and the culture of a place that are momentous for the origin of fairs and their continuity through the generations. Thus, it is imperative to explore the diversities of fairs both in rural and urban settings of Bengal. Here, we used the available secondary data for entire Bengal to map out the regional patterns of fairs. Categorically, all the fairs were filtered using selected criteria and finally 979 were considered for the study out of 2023 by using Census data. Finding of the study reveals the regional patterns of fairs, which further tells on the spatio-temporal narratives along with the story of the traditionality and urban-rural connection with fairs. Again, the contribution of this paper establishes the linkages among the physical attributes, cultural imprint and fairs.

AB  - This paper proposes a real-time allocation scheme for photonic networks that use wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) technologies in the backbone and ring regional networks, respectively. A frame that is used for transferring data and control information in a ring regional network takes only one round to complete data allocation processing, instead of two rounds as required by the prior reservation scheme, so that data can be transmitted immediately. The objective is to provide max-min fair share in terms of throughput with just one round. If no free space is left on the frame, the proposed scheme allows a group (some) of the newly requested data to replace some of the already allocated data to provide max-min fair share, in terms of throughput. Data replacement and defragmentation are processed in the optical domain. Simulations show that the proposed scheme maintains max-min fair share even in unbalanced traffic scenarios. The complexity of defragmentation depends on the number of delay lines needed to regenerate the original data groups. The maximum number of delay lines is determined.

AB  - The relationships between book fairs and tourism have been scarcely studied in previous literature. While their potential to attract tourists within the context of cultural and heritage tourism practices seems obvious, their impact has been only analysed in terms of visitors' data, which predominantly relies on business tourists. Based on semi-structured interviews with publishing, literature and tourism experts within the Iberoamerican context, this article discusses the possibilities that book fairs offer as tourist products. Results show that there is a significant space for their tourist development.

AB  - Data-driven recommender algorithms are widely used in many systems, such as e-commerce recommender systems and movie recommendation systems. However, these systems could be affected by data bias, which leads to unfair recommendations for different groups of users. To address this problem, we propose a group rank fair recommender (GRFRec) method to mitigate the unfairness of recommender algorithms. We design a self-supervised learning framework to enhance user representation from both global and local views for fair results. In addition, adversarial learning is introduced to eliminate group-specific information and results in an unbiased user-item representation space, which avoids some groups suffering from unfair treatment in recommender results. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GRFRec can not only significantly improve fairness but also attain better results on the recommendation accuracy.

AB  - Partial order methods alleviate state explosion by considering only a subset of actions in each constructed state. The choice of the subset depends on the properties that the method promises to preserve. Many methods have been developed ranging from deadlock-preserving to CTL*-preserving and divergence-sensitive branching bisimilarity preserving. The less the method preserves, the smaller state spaces it constructs. Fair testing equivalence unifies deadlocks with livelocks that cannot be exited and ignores the other livelocks. It is the weakest congruence that preserves whether or not the system may enter a livelock that it cannot leave. We prove that a method that was designed for trace equivalence also preserves fair testing equivalence. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a protocol with a connection and data transfer phase. This is the first practical partial order method that deals with a practical fairness assumption.

AB  - With recent rapid increases in the number of devices connected to wireless networks, the importance of scalable radio resource management operating in a distributed manner and the role of fairness among nodes are critical aspects in ensuring reliable services to numerous nodes in such network environments. In this paper, we consider the Kuramoto model for achieving fair and distributed radio resource allocation in a wireless network. Because, the conventional Kuramoto model is designed for synchronization only and is thus not suitable for fair resource allocation, we propose a modified Kuramoto-Desync model, whose purpose is to achieve fair resource allocation among nodes in a distributed manner. The proposed Kuramoto-Desync model evenly spaces the phases of all the nodes in the network. By mapping the evenly spaced phase interval of each node to the time-division multiple access or TDMA-based data time slot, we achieve fair resource allocation among contending nodes in a distributed way. The necessary condition for the convergence of the Kuramoto-Desync model is analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed model successfully performs fair resource allocation even in dynamic network topology and that the convergence speed of the proposed model is quite stable compared to that of the comparison model.

KW  - DESIGN
AB  - Aerodynamic shape optimization of launch vehicle hammerhead payload fairing (PLF) boat tail shapes has been carried out. Multi-objective optimization studies have been carried out to minimize the boat tail length, drag coefficient, the length of separated flow behind the boat tail, and the maximum pressure ratio over the boat tail. The boat tail shape has been parameterized using a B-spline. A novel optimal shape has been obtained, which has a shallow initial slope followed by a rapid increase in the slope near the boat tail end, termed the ramp stepped boat tail (RSBT). The optimization study has been carried out by varying the stage-to-PLF diameter ratios. A novel parameterization strategy has been employed, which convexifies the design space. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have been carried out on 950 different boat tail configurations sampled using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) at Mach number 0.8. Results from CFD have been validated against experimental data from literature. Artificial neural networks have been used as surrogate models for computing the objectives. Multi-objective optimization was carried out using the genetic algorithm for various stage-to-PLF diameter ratios. Pareto-optimal fronts obtained have been analyzed, and optimal shapes derived from them have been validated using CFD. It is found that the optimal RSBT configuration is found to be advantageous over the conventional conical boat tail in reducing drag, separated flow length, boat tail length, shock strength, and the turbulent kinetic energy downstream of the boat tail.

AB  - This article presents the fair share methodology, a new development approach and perspective for policymaking, for countries struggling to achieve higher returns in higher education. The methodology involves the use of the fair share index as a measure to account for the rising trend of inequality and how its impact on societal well-being and community productivity to rise above poverty can be limited. The approach is innovative as it uses district-level empirical data to calculate the fair share index, the equity index and the equity gap in access to higher education as a development resource across time and space, allowing for inter-district and inter-temporal comparisons in trends of inequality/deprivation and what can be done to limit it. It offers policy makers, in developing countries an effective tool to ensure the benefits of development are more equitably distributed, such that no one is left behind. The methodology incorporates 'equity' as a third dimension of resource distribution, placing the discours of fair share in development literature and practice in ways not previously reported.

AB  - Atmospheric electricity measurements made from small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are rare but are of increasing interest to the atmospheric science community due to the information that they can provide about aerosol and turbulence characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Here we present the first analysis of a new data-set of space charge and meteorology measurements made from the small, electric, fixed-wing UAS model MASC-3. Two distinct experiments are discussed: 1) Flights past a 99 m metal tower to test the response of the charge sensor to a fixed distortion of the electric field caused by the geometry of the tower. Excellent agreement is found between the charge sensor response from the MASC-3 and modeled electric field around the tower. 2) Vertical profiles up to an altitude of 2500 m to study the evolution of the ABL with the time of day. These flights demonstrated close agreement between the space charge profiles and temperature, relative humidity, and turbulence parameters, as would be expected on a fair-weather day with summertime convection. Maximum values of space charge measured were of order 70 pC m(-3), comparable with other measurements in the literature from balloon platforms. These measurements demonstrate the suitability of small UAS for atmospheric electrical measurements, provided that care is taken over the choice of aircraft platform, sensor placement, minimization of electrical interference, and careful choice of the flight path. Such aircraft are typically more cost-effective than manned aircraft and are being increasingly used for atmospheric science purposes.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the field of Earth science at a science fair. For this purpose, 566 pieces of data spanning 21 years (2000 to 2020), acquired from entries in the Earth Science section on the science fair website, were analyzed using the semantic network method. As a result, geoscience topics have been actively explored in works submitted for the Earth Science section of the science fair. Fossils from the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic Era were particularly predominant. Together with these, keywords corresponding to astronomy, space science, and atmospheric science formed a small-scale network. Astronomy and space science mainly dealt with the dynamic characteristics of asteroids, Venus, and Jupiter. Other subjects included the solar system, sunspots, and lunar phases. Atmospheric science has focused on atmospheric physics, atmospheric observation and analysis technology, atmospheric dynamics, air quality monitoring, while marine science has been limited to physical oceanography and geologic oceanography. This study, is expected to help select Earth Science topics and conduct inquiry activities in schools.

AB  - To address time unfairness access problems in the dynamic channel, an underwater adaptive contention window (CW) adjustment backoff algorithm (QL-UACW) based on Q-learning is presented in this paper. That algorithm employs the concept of reinforcement learning to adaptively adjust the competition window by autonomously learning the network communication process. Based on QL-UACW and in order to address space unfairness access issues of nodes location, a load adaptive hybrid media access control (MAC) protocol with competition for the same directional nodes and time slot allocation for different directional nodes called SDHA is also presented. The protocol divides the nodes into co-nodes and counter-nodes according to the relative communication directions of the nodes. The co-nodes use competition protocol and the counter-nodes use time slot allocation protocol to solve the hidden terminal problem of node communication in order to prevent space access unfairness. Theoretical and simulation analysis show that the QL-UACW algorithm effectively improves the fairness of node access channels, reduces the collision rate of data frames, and increases network throughput. Additionally, the SDHA protocol is proven to provide advantages in normalized network throughput, average end-to-end delay, and the success rate of data frame transmission.

AB  - The scientific community has tried to implement the FAIR guiding principles to foster open science actions in data-driven research in higher education since 2016. However, what strategies work and do not in fostering open science actions still need to be determined. This article is the first step to closing this research gap by examining one strategy, the effectiveness of FAIR training in higher education. With a pre-post test design, the study evaluates the short-term effectiveness of FAIR training on students' scientific suggestions and justifications in line with FAIR's guiding principles. The study also assesses the influence of university legal frameworks on students' inclination towards FAIR training. Before FAIR training, 81.1% of students suggested that scientific actions were not in line with the FAIR guiding principles. However, there is a 3.75-fold increase in suggestions that adhere to these principles after the training. Interestingly, the training does not significantly impact how students justify FAIR actions. The study observes a positive correlation between the presence of university legal frameworks on FAIR guiding principles and students' inclination towards FAIR training. The study underscores the training potential in driving the transition towards open science actions in higher education and shows how much university legal frameworks can push toward such training. Students rate FAIR training as very useful and satisfactory. Important learning factors in effective FAIR training seem to be creating a safe space, letting students contribute, and encouraging students to engage in the training. However, the study also reveals the need for further training improvement, particularly in enhancing students' ability to justify FAIR actions.

AB  - There is great need for coordination around standards and best practices in neuroscience to support efforts to make neuroscience a data-centric discipline. Major brain initiatives launched around the world are poised to generate huge stores of neuroscience data. At the same time, neuroscience, like many domains in biomedicine, is confronting the issues of transparency, rigor, and reproducibility. Widely used, validated standards and best practices are key to addressing the challenges in both big and small data science, as they are essential for integrating diverse data and for developing a robust, effective, and sustainable infrastructure to support open and reproducible neuroscience. However, developing community standards and gaining their adoption is difficult. The current landscape is characterized both by a lack of robust, validated standards and a plethora of overlapping, underdeveloped, untested and underutilized standards and best practices. The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF), an independent organization dedicated to promoting data sharing through the coordination of infrastructure and standards, has recently implemented a formal procedure for evaluating and endorsing community standards and best practices in support of the FAIR principles. By formally serving as a standards organization dedicated to open and FAIR neuroscience, INCF helps evaluate, promulgate, and coordinate standards and best practices across neuroscience. Here, we provide an overview of the process and discuss how neuroscience can benefit from having a dedicated standards body.

AB  - Similarity search is a fundamental algorithmic primitive, widely used in many computer science disciplines. Given a set of points S and a radius parameter r > 0, the r-near neighbor (r-NN) problem asks for a data structure that, given any query point q, returns a point p within distance at most r from q. In this paper, we study the r-NN problem in the light of individual fairness and providing equal opportunities: all points that are within distance r from the query should have the same probability to be returned. In the low-dimensional case, this problem was first studied by Hu, Qiao, and Tao (PODS 2014). Locality sensitive hashing (LSH), the theoretically strongest approach to similarity search in high dimensions, does not provide such a fairness guarantee.
   In this work, we show that LSH based algorithms can be made fair, without a significant loss in efficiency. We propose several efficient data structures for the exact and approximate variants of the fair NN problem. Our approach works more generally for sampling uniformly from a sub-collection of sets of a given collection and can be used in a few other applications. We also develop a data structure for fair similarity search under inner product that requires nearly-linear space and exploits locality sensitive filters. The paper concludes with an experimental evaluation that highlights the unfairness of state-of-the-art NN data structures and shows the performance of our algorithms on real-world datasets.

AB  - Generalized zero-shot diagnosis (GZSD) for industrial processes has gained increasing attention as it aims to diagnose both seen and unseen faults based on fault attributes. Nevertheless, the lack of unseen fault data for training poses a critical domain shift problem (DSP), where a biased model prediction toward seen faults is caused by overfitting available seen fault data so that unseen faults tend to be falsely identified as seen faults. Therefore, we propose a Fault Attribute-driven bIas calibRation (FAIR) model to address the model bias toward seen faults, which consists of a bias calibration module and a generation module based on attribute feature recombination. The proposed bias calibration module is the first gating mechanism designed in the attribute space to differentiate between seen and unseen faults. Different from existing methods that construct the boundary for both faults in the feature space, we first propose to employ attributes of unseen faults as substitutes for unavailable training samples to construct the classification boundary in the attribute space, thereby mitigating the model bias caused by the lack of unseen fault features. To further alleviate the DSP, we propose a generation module to generate samples for unseen faults. In particular, to improve the quality of generated samples, the generation module leverages fault attribute features extracted from seen faults and recombines them under the guidance of fault attributes. We conduct GZSD experiments on a real hydraulic system and the Tennessee-Eastman process (TEP) benchmark dataset. In comparison with the SOTA methods, the proposed method achieves an average improvement of 11.84% in terms of the harmonic mean of the accuracy of seen and unseen faults on the TEP, and 6.22% on the real hydraulic system.

AB  - A long data record (14 yr) of ground-based observations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site is analyzed to document the macroscopic and dynamical properties of daytime fair-weather cumulus clouds during summer months. First, a fuzzy logic-based algorithm is developed to eliminate insect radar echoes in the boundary layer that hinder the ability to develop representative cloud statistics. The refined dataset is used to document the daytime composites of fair-weather cumulus clouds properties. Doppler velocities are processed for lower reflectivity thresholds that contain small cloud droplets having insignificant terminal velocities; thus, Doppler velocities are used as tracers of air motion. The algorithm is implemented to process the entire 14-yr dataset of cloud radar vertical velocity data. Composite diurnal variations of the cloud vertical velocity statistics, surface parameters, and profiles of updraft and downdraft fractions, bulk velocity of updrafts and downdrafts, and updraft and downdraft mass flux are calculated. Statistics on the cloud geometrical properties such as cloud thickness, cloud chord length, cloud spacing, and aspect ratios are calculated on the cloud scale. The present dataset provides a unique insight into the daytime evolution and statistical description of the turbulent structure inside fair-weather cumuli over land.

AB  - MRI is important for the assessment of cardiac structure and function in preclinical studies of cardiac disease. Arterial spin labeling techniques can be used to measure perfusion noninvasively. In this study, an electrocardiogram-gated Look-Locker sequence with segmented k-space acquisition has been implemented to acquire single slice arterial spin labeling data sets in 15 min in the mouse heart. A data logger was introduced to improve data quality by: (1) allowing automated rejection of respiration-corrupted images, (2) providing additional prospective gating to improve consistency of acquisition timing, and (3) allowing the recombination of uncorrupted k-space lines from consecutive data sets to reduce respiration corruption. Finally, variability and repeatability of perfusion estimation within-session, between-session, between-animal, and between image rejection criteria were assessed in mice. The criterion used to reject images from the T1 fit was shown to affect the perfusion estimation. These data showed that the between-animal coefficient of variability (24%) was greater than the between-session variability (17%) and within-session variability (11%). Furthermore, the magnitude of change in perfusion required to detect differences was 30% (within-session) and 55% (between-session) according to Bland-Altman repeatability analysis. These technique developments and repeatability statistics will provide a platform for future preclinical studies applying cardiac arterial spin labeling. Magn Reson Med, 2013.

AB  - Fair-weather data along the May June 2002 International H2O Project (IHOP_2002) eastern track and the nearby Argonne Boundary Layer Experiments (ABLE) facility in southeast Kansas are compared to numerical simulations to gain insight into how the surface influences convective boundary layer (CBL) structure, and to evaluate the success of the modeling system in replicating the observed behavior. Simulations are conducted for 4 days, using the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled to the Noah land surface model (LSM), initialized using the High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS). Because the observations focus on phenomena less than 60 km in scale, the model is run with 1-km grid spacing, offering a critical look at high-resolution model behavior in an environment uncomplicated by precipitation.
   The model replicates the type of CBL structure on scales from a few kilometers to 100 km, but some features at the kilometer scales depend on the grid spacing. Mesoscale (tens of kilometers) circulations were clearly evident on 2 of the 4 days (30 May and 20 June), clearly not evident on 1 day (22 June), with the situation for the fourth day (17 June) ambiguous. Both observed and modeled surface-heterogeneity-generated mesoscale circulations are evident for 30 May. On the other hand, 20 June satellite images show north-northwest south-southeast cloud streets (rolls) modulated longitudinally, presumably by tropospheric gravity waves oriented normal to the roll axis, creating northeast southwest ridges and valleys spaced 50-100 km apart. Modeled cloud streets showed similar longitudinal modulation, with the associated two-dimensional structure having maximum amplitude above the CBL and no relationship to the CBL temperature distribution; although there were patches of mesoscale vertical velocity correlated with CBL temperature. On 22 June, convective rolls were the dominant structure in both model and observations.
   For the 3 days for which satellite images show cloud streets, WRF produces rolls with the right orientation and wavelength, which grows with CBL depth. Modeled roll structures appeared for the range of CBL depth to Obukhov length ratios (z(i)/L) associated with rolls. However, sensitivity tests show that the roll wavelength is also related to the grid spacing, and the modeled convection becomes more cellular with smaller grid spacing.

AB  - Reverse engineering of 3D industrial objects such as automobiles and electric appliances is typically performed by fitting B-spline surfaces to scanned point cloud data with a fairing term to ensure smoothness, which often smooths out sharp features. This paper proposes a radically different approach to constructing fair B-spline surfaces, which consists of fitting a surface without a fairing term to capture sharp edges, smoothing the normal field of the constructed surface with feature preservation, and reconstructing the B-spline surface from the smoothed normal field. The core of our method is an image processing based feature-preserving normal field fairing technique. This is inspired by the success of many recent research works on the use of normal field for reconstructing mesh models, and makes use of the impressive simplicity and effectiveness of bilateral-like filtering for image denoising. In particular, our approach adaptively partitions the B-spline surface into a set of segments such that each segment has approximately uniform parameterization, generates an image from each segment in the parameter space whose pixel values are the normal vectors of the surface, and then applies a bilateral filter in the parameter domain to fair the normal field. As a result, our approach inherits the advantages of image bilateral filtering techniques and is able to effectively smooth B-spline surfaces with feature preservation as demonstrated by various examples.

AB  - The NVMe zoned namespace (ZNS) is a new type of storage interface, which divides logical address space intofixed-size zones, and each zone strictly follows a sequential write constraint with a write pointer. Owing to the sequential write constraint of the ZNS, I/O requests would not be scheduled arbitrarily like the traditional solid state drives (SSDs) with a block interface. When multiple applications concurrently access one ZNS SSD hardware, the constraint deteriorates I/O blocking and causes huge unfairness. To resolve the problem, we propose a self-balance I/O scheduling dedicated for ZNS SSDs, called Fair-ZNS, to balance the slowdown among multiple applications and ensure fairness. Fair-ZNS identifies the unfair requests by the maximums lowdown value, and violently schedules these requests into the head of the queues overcoming the sequential write constraint. To eliminate the negative effect of the violent scheduling, Fair-ZNS deploys a self-balancing coordinator to fine-tune the orderof the requests. Comprehensive evaluations show that Fair-ZNS alleviates I/O blocking and reduces average waiting time by 8.3x,increases fairness by 2.3x, and decreases the max slowdown by5.1xaveragely when compared to the current ZNS SSDs.

AB  - In March 2021, a case of speculation that abused private internal information came to light, which involved a group of public officials from the Korea Land and Housing Corporation (LH), and has since been labeled the 'LH Scandal'. In this scandal, land was misappropriated as a means of creating fraudulent values, instead of returning it to marginalized people in real need of residential space. As a result of this, preventive measures for similar cases have become warranted. Consequently, related laws have been passed, but this is only expected to show its effect as a follow-up response, therefore requiring a preemptive response plan. In this paper, we will propose a conceptual framework that can detect speculation that abuses private internal information, enabling a preemptive response, utilizing outlier detection and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods. The system is designed to create a database (DB) with private inside real estate information, which is linked to another DB with a list of outlier-detected areas that can potentially indicate speculation, and then the system confirms any speculation by comparing the two DBs accordingly. Once a speculation case is confirmed, the system automatically reports the case to the investigative agency. By using this system, we expect to detect hidden speculation cases already committed, as well as speculation cases in real-time. Ultimately, we hope to protect the original purpose of redevelopment and the construction of new towns (housing/retail mixed-use zones), redistributing available land on behalf of marginalized people, who are lacking in residential space, by raising the utility of land.

AB  - High-radix router based on the tile structure requires large amount of buffer resources. To reduce the buffer space requirement without degrading the throughput of the router, shared buffer management schemes like dynamically allocated multi-queue (DAMQ) can be used by improving the buffer utilization. Unfortunately, it is commonly regarded that DAMQ is slow in write and read. To address this issue, we propose a fast and fair DAMQ structure called F2DAMQ for high-radix routers in this paper. It uses a fast FIFO structure in the implementation of idle address list as well as data buffer and achieves some critical performance improvement such as continuous and concurrent write and read with zero-delay. Besides, F2DAMQ also uses a novel credit management mechanism which is efficient in avoiding one virtual channel (VC) monopolizing the shared part of the buffer and achieving fairness among competing VCs sharing the buffer. The analyses and simulations show that F2DAMQ performs well in achieving low latency, high throughput and good fairness under different traffic patterns.

AB  - Results of near-surface measurements of atmospheric electric field and meteorological parameters at the Indian Antarctic station, Maitri, during 12 fair-weather days of January and February, 2005, are presented. Data are analyzed to study the diurnal variation of the electric field and its departure, if any, from the global electric fields. Fair-weather days are classified into two groups depending upon the average of the hourly surface temperature. Group one, when the average of the hourly surface temperature is mostly above the freezing point, and group two, when the same is below the freezing point. The role of different ion sizes on the Maxwell current density and the air-Earth current density for the two groups are quite different under different conditions. To study the effect of ions on the atmospheric electric fields, ions are grouped as small ions, intermediate ions and large ions. We find that the small and the large ions largely influence the air-Earth current density with a correlation coefficient higher than 70%. The intermediate ions have a negative correlation in the case of group one fair-weather days, whereas for group two days no correlation is found. The diurnal variations of the Maxwell current density and the electric field show a peak between 1800 UT and 2000 UT and the nature of the variation can be attributed to the variation in worldwide thunderstorm activity. The correlation coefficient between the measured electric field and the electric field from the Carnegie curve is 0.93 with a <0.0001 significance level. Thus, the observed electric field at Maitri represents the global electric field. The results show that a wind velocity of less than 10 m/s and a surface temperature of lower than +7 degrees C have almost no impact on the electric field and Maxwell current density.

AB  - Edge computing is an emerging solution to support the future Internet of Things (IoT) applications that are delay-sensitive, processing-intensive or that require closer intelligence. Machine intelligence and data-driven approaches are envisioned to build future Edge-IoT systems that satisfy IoT devices' demands for edge resources. However, significant challenges and technical barriers exist which complicate the resource management for such Edge-IoT systems. IoT devices running various applications can demonstrate a wide range of behaviors in the devices' resource demand that are extremely difficult to manage. In addition, the management of multidimensional resources fairly and efficiently by the edge in such a setting is a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a novel data-driven resource management framework named BEHAVE that intelligently and fairly allocates edge resources to heterogeneous IoT devices with consideration of their behavior of resource demand (BRD). BEHAVE aims to holistically address the management technical barriers by: 1) building an efficient scheme for modeling and assessment of the BRD of IoT devices based on their resource requests and resource usage; 2) expanding a new Rational, Fair, and Truthful Resource Allocation (RFTA) model that binds the devices' BRD and resource allocation to achieve fair allocation and encourage truthfulness in resource demand; and 3) developing an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (EDRL) scheme to achieve the RFTA goals. The evaluation results demonstrate BEHAVE's capability to analyze the IoT devices' BRD and adjust its resource management policy accordingly.

AB  - Renewable energy's inherent randomness and intermittency pose a significant challenge to current grid control and operation as the energy mix transitions to green and clean energy. While a body of reinforcement learning (RL)-based research on automated power grid control has shown great potential and exciting promise for improving grid operations' economic efficiency and security, little work has focused on fairness issues. To this end, we propose hierarchical multiobjective Markov decision process (HMO-MDP), a power grid control and decision model considering the fairness between the power plants on the energy supply side grounded on a structurally hierarchical multiobjective markov decision process (MO-MDP) we suggested. Specifically, our model: 1) develops an innovative hierarchical multiobjective optimization function and a brand-new reward function to improve the fairness of long-term supply-side gains; 2) introduces the Generalized Gini Index (GGI), a fairness metric based on ranking from economics, to measure the fairness of long-term supply-side gains reasonably; and 3) leverages auto-encoder block to capture the stable representation of the high-dimensional state in low-dimensional space, to reduce the state space and thus enhance generalization of the model. Furthermore, with the proposed model implemented under the A2C framework, we present two algorithms, hierarchical multiobjective A2C (HMO-A2C) and hierarchical multiobjective proximal policy optimization (HMO-PPO), for fair automated power grid control. We comprehensively evaluate our algorithms on the publicly available, data-driven simulator. Experimental results show that our algorithms can effectively promote the fairness of grid control and operation on the supply side, while ensuring security and holding suitable environmental adaptability.

AB  - Metaverse is a digital space that aims to build a fully immersive, hyper spatio-temporal virtual world for human interaction. It is very promising to apply metaverse into personal healthcare to improve the quality and efficiency of personal healthcare services. Several challenges, such as patient data security and privacy issues, are hindering the application of metaverse healthcare. To protect data security and privacy of healthcare, swarm learning is proposed by integrating distributed machine learning and blockchain. However, the existing swarm learning framework often faces additional issues of security and fairness in metaverse healthcare, such as security concerns caused by multiple anonymous avatars and uneven distribution of data quality. In this article, we propose a swarm learning-based model sharing framework to enhance the security and fairness of healthcare-AI model sharing in the metaverse. The proposed metaverse swarm learning can support the privacy-protection global model and partial model parameters merging. Moreover, the decentralized autonomous organization blockchain network is proposed to guarantee the fairness of model sharing gains among the imbalance of healthcare resource data. Simulation results on two practical healthcare datasets show that our proposed model-sharing can achieve better accuracy than local training and approximate accuracy compared to central training.

AB  - A modified atmospheric electrical station of the Kasemir-Dolezalek construction is continuously operating in the Marsta Observatory (59 degrees 56'N, 17 degrees 35'W) located in rural area 10 km north of Uppsala, Sweden. The routinely recorded parameters are the electric field, positive and negative polar conductivities of air, and space charge density. The effect of possible local anthropogenic air pollution on the fair weather atmospheric electric measurements at Marsta is estimated according to Sheftel et al., 1994a (J. Geophys. Res. 99, 10,793) by comparing the Sunday and weekday values of air conductivity. The effect of local air pollution appears essentially less than at other evaluated continental atmospheric electric stations. The natural periodic variations of fair weather electric field and vertical air-earth current averaged over many years at Marsta are compared with the periodic variations of electric field measured during the Carnegie expeditions over the oceans where the global component of variations dominates over the local component. The diurnal variations of electric field and vertical current at Marsta are well correlated with the Carnegie curve during winter and ill correlated during summer. The correlation coefficient reaches 98% for the winter measurements of vertical air-earth current. In addition, a test has been carried out for a hypothesis that numerical reduction of the data according to the local temperature and wind variation could suppress the local component of fair weather atmospheric electric variations and thus help to study the global component of variation. The hypothesis proved to be inadequate. The reduction suppresses the annual variation, but the shape of the diurnal variation remains the same and the correlation with the Carnegie curve is even worse than in the case of unreduced measurements. The Marsta Observatory is recommended as a basis station for long-term routine atmospheric electric measurements to gather data for the study of climate variation because of the large weight of global component in the variation of fair weather air-earth vertical current and electric field.

AB  - Data processing is a key challenge for computationally limited Ground Users (GUs) in various applications. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) servers can assist GUs by offloading their computing tasks. However, existing work ignores fairness when multiple GUs compete for limited computing resources, which may result in UAV underserving certain GUs. In this paper, we investigate a flight trajectory optimization based on reinforcement learning for UAV selection of target GUs for task computation, which provides low latency and fair offloading computing services for GUs by jointly training UAV flight trajectories and task offloading decisions. We formulate UAV flight and offloading as a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem with high-dimensional state and action spaces. The problem is then transformed into a Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) problem and the Maximizing Service Efficiency Proximal Policy Optimization (MSE-PPO) algorithm is proposed to find the optimal solution. The algorithm adopts an actor-critic-based parallel architecture to handle the parameterized action space. Specifically, the UAV position sequence is updated while ensuring an optimal offloading policy between the UAV and the GUs. Simulation results verify that the average system rewards including computational energy efficiency and fairness index are improved by 35.06%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\%$$\end{document} and 12.10%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\%$$\end{document} respectively compared to DDPG and PPO algorithms.

AB  - A composite grid-stiffened structure concept was selected for the payload fairing of the Minotaur launch vehicle. Compared to sandwich structures, this concept has an advantage of smaller manufacturing costs and lighter weight. To reduce weight the skin pockets are allowed to buckle visibly up to about 0.5 cm peak displacement.
   Various failure modes were examined for the composite grid-stiffened structure. The controlling criterion for this design was a joint failure in tension between the ribs and skin of the structure. The identification of this failure mechanism and the assessment of bounding strains required to control it required extensive test and analysis effort. Increasing skin thickness to control skin buckling resulted in reduced strains between the skin and ribs.
   Following the identification of the relevant failure criteria, a final design for the fairing was generated. The resulting 6 in tall fairing was constructed of a tow-placed carbon fiber composite grid structure that was over-wrapped to create a laminated skin. Upon completion of curing and machining, the fairing was cut in half to create the classic "clam-shell" fairing. Static qualification testing demonstrated the structural integrity of the fairing, thereby proving the design and manufacturing process. Loads were applied incrementally in a static loading scenario. The applied load envelope exceeded worst-case dynamic flight conditions with an added safety factor of 25%. At peak load the fairing maintained structural integrity while remaining within the required displacement envelope for payload safety.
   Data were collected during the test from a variety of sensors including traditional displacement transducers and strain gages. In addition, full field displacement was monitored at critically loaded fairing sections by means of digital photogrammetry. This paper summarizes the test results, presents the overall performance of the fairing under the test loads, correlates test response and analysis, and identifies lessons learned.
   Work continues at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Boeing to identify means of further controlling tensile failure of the un-reinforced polymer bonded joint between the ribs and skin. Stiffening of skin adjacent to the joints and introduction of lightweight foam jackets at the interior of the fairing both show promise of delaying joint failure to higher loads.

AB  - The establishment of protected areas is one of the most common environmental policy tools which can effectively contribute to landscape protection, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem services provision. In this sense, the Brazilian Law on Native Vegetation Protection establishes the legal reserves, mandatory protected spaces within private rural lands, which seek to maintain and restore ecological functions and promote biodiversity conservation. This paper aims to present an approach that attempted to locate potential protected spaces, in the form of legal reserves, in the East Zone of Ribeirao Preto - a recharge zone of the Guarani Aquifer System. We made use of seven criteria to create five possible scenarios with varying priorities for native vegetation protection or restoration. Then, we used eight landscape metrics, as well as the level of compliance with the law, to discuss the viability of each scenario in terms of ecological thresholds and landscape indicators. We found only one scenario (the broader perspective on recovering the natural vegetation corridors) capable of meeting the ecological and legal requirements. We conclude that using less data-demanding methods, such as the one applied in this research, could be useful in assisting decision-making regarding the selection of areas for conservation or restoration.

AB  - A typical railway crew scheduling problem consists of two phases: a crew pairing problem to determine a set of crew duties and a crew rostering problem. The crew rostering problem aims to find a set of rosters that forms workforce assignment of crew duties and rest periods satisfying several working regulations. In this paper, we present a two-level decomposition approach to solve railway crew rostering problem with the objective of fair working condition. To reduce computational efforts, the original problem is decomposed into the upper-level master problem and the lower-level subproblem. The subproblem can be further decomposed into several subproblems for each roster. These problems are iteratively solved by incorporating cuts into the master problem. We show that the relaxed problem of the master problem can be formulated as a uniform parallel machine scheduling problem to minimize makespan, which is NP-hard. An efficient branch-and-bound algorithm is applied to solve the master problem. Effective valid cuts are developed to reduce feasible search space to tighten the duality gap. Using data provided by the railway company, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with that of constraint programming techniques for large-scale problems through computational experiments.

AB  - Crew Module Fairing (CMF) for Pad Abort Test (PAT) of Crew Escape System (CES) is configured and designed with the objective of flight qualifying necessary features like external aerodynamic shape, thermal protection system, along with Escape Motors (namely Low-altitude Escape Motor (LEM) and High-altitude Escape Motor (HEM)), with interfaces simulated as in actual flight. For improving the aerodynamic stability of the vehicle, four grid fins are attached at the aft end of CMF. Interfaces for mounting LEM, HEM, grid fins along with its deployment mechanisms and Crew Module through CM-CES attachment have been provided on CMF.
   The design was supported by rigorous analysis, both 2D as well as 3D, of different sub-assemblies and interface joints for the respective critical load cases. To meet the challenges of launch requirements and schedule, the feasibility of combining tests of varying nature has been explored. By meticulous planning of the test scheme, set-up, load cases and instrumentation, and through a judicious combination of test and analysis, structural qualification of CMF could be achieved meeting the mission schedule. CMF has been successfully flown in PAT, as evident from radar monitoring. Post-flight analysis of strain data indicates the integrity and good health of CMF during the entire phase of the mission.

AB  - In this paper, we propose and investigate the individually fair k-center with outliers (IFkCO). In the IFkCO, we are given an n-sized vertex set in a metric space, as well as integers k and q. At most k vertices can be selected as the centers and at most q vertices can be selected as the outliers. The centers are selected to serve all the not-an-outlier (i.e., served) vertices. The so-called individual fairness constraint restricts that every served vertex must have a selected center not too far way. More precisely, it is supposed that there exists at least one center among its [(n - q)/k] closest neighbors for every served vertex. Because every center serves (n - q)/k vertices on the average. The objective is to select centers and outliers, assign every served vertex to some center, such that the maximum fairness ratio over all served vertices is minimized, where the fairness ratio of a vertex is defined as the ratio between its distance with the assigned center and its distance with a [(n - q)/k](th) closest neighbor. As our main contribution, a 4-approximation algorithm is presented, based on which we develop an improved algorithm from a practical perspective. Extensive experiment results on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

TI  - Influence of short-term solar disturbances on the fair weather conduction current
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPACE WEATHER AND SPACE CLIMATE
LA  - English
AB  - The fair weather atmospheric electrical current (J(z)) couples the ionosphere to the lower atmosphere and thus provides a route by which changes in solar activity can modify processes in the lower troposphere. This paper examines the temporal variations and spectral characteristics of continuous measurements of J(z) conducted at the Wise Observatory in Mitzpe-Ramon, Israel (30 degrees 35' N, 34 degrees 45' E), during two large CMEs, and during periods of increased solar wind density.
   Evidence is presented for the effects of geomagnetic storms and sub-storms on low latitude J(z) during two coronal mass ejections (CMEs), on 24-25th October 2011 and 7-8th March 2012, when the variability in J(z) increased by an order of magnitude compared to normal fair weather conditions. The dynamic spectrum of the increased J(z) fluctuations exhibit peaks in the Pc5 frequency range. Similar low frequency characteristics occur during periods of enhanced solar wind proton density. During the October 2011 event, the periods of increased fluctuations in J(z) lasted for 7 h and coincided with fluctuations of the inter-planetary magnetic field (IMF) detected by the ACE satellite. We suggest downward mapping of ionospheric electric fields as a possible mechanism for the increased fluctuations.

AB  - Our aim is to contribute to the classification of anomalous patterns in biosignals using this novel approach. We specifically focus on melanoma and heart murmurs. We use a comparative study of two convolution networks in the Complex and Real numerical domains. The idea is to obtain a powerful approach for building portable systems for early disease detection. Two similar algorithmic structures were chosen so that there is no bias determined by the number of parameters to train. Three clinical data sets, ISIC2017, PH2, and Pascal, were used to carry out the experiments. Mean comparison hypothesis tests were performed to ensure statistical objectivity in the conclusions. In all cases, complex-valued networks presented a superior performance for the Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy, and Specificity metrics in the detection of associated anomalies. The best complex number-based classifier obtained in the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) space presents a Euclidean distance of 0.26127 with respect to the ideal classifier, as opposed to the best real number-based classifier, whose Euclidean distance to the ideal is 0.36022 for the same task of melanoma detection. The 27.46% superiority in this metric, as in the others reported in this work, suggests that complex-valued networks have a greater ability to extract features for more efficient discrimination in the dataset.

AB  - Ranking items or people is a fundamental operation at the basis of several processes and services, not all of them happening online. Ranking is required for different tasks, including search, personalization, recommendation, and filtering. While traditionally ranking has been aimed solely at maximizing some global utility function, recently the awareness of potential discrimination for some of the elements to rank, has captured the attention of researchers, which have thus started devising ranking systems which are non-discriminatory or fair for the items being ranked. So far, researchers have mostly focused on group fairness, which is usually expressed in the form of constraints on the fraction of elements from some protected groups that should be included in the top -k positions, for any relevant k. These constraints are needed in order to correct implicit societal biases existing in the input data and reflected in the relevance or fitness score computed. In this article, we tackle the problem of selecting a subset of k individuals from a pool of n , k candidates, maximizing global utility (i.e., selecting the "best'' candidates) while respecting given group-fairness criteria. In particular, to tackle this Fair Top-k Ranking problem, we adopt a ranked group-fairness definition which extends the standard notion of group fairness based on protected groups, by ensuring that the proportion of protected candidates in every prefix of the top -k ranking remains statistically above, or indistinguishable from, a given minimum threshold. Our notion of utility requires, intuitively, that every individual included in the top -k should be more qualified than every candidate not included; and that for every pair of candidates in the top -k, the more qualified candidate should be ranked above. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm for producing a fair top -k ranking that can be used when more than one protected group is present, which means that a statistical test based on a multinomial distribution needs to be used instead of one for a binomial distribution, as the original FA*IR algorithms does. This poses important technical challenges and increases both the space and time complexity of the re-ranking algorithm. Our experimental assessment on real-world datasets shows that our approach yields small distortions with respect to rankings that maximize utility without considering our fairness criteria.

AB  - On November 26, 2011, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) launched from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas V 541 rocket, taking its first step toward exploring the past habitability of Mars' Gale Crater. Because microbial contamination could profoundly impact the integrity of the mission, and compliance with international treaty was a necessity, planetary protection measures were implemented on all MSL hardware to verify that bioburden levels complied with NASA regulations. The cleanliness of the Atlas V payload fairing (PLF) and associated ground support systems used to launch MSL were also evaluated. By applying proper recontamination countermeasures early and often in the encapsulation process, the PLF was kept extremely clean and was shown to pose little threat of recontaminating the enclosed MSL flight system upon launch. Contrary to prelaunch estimates that assumed that the interior PLF spore burden ranged from 500 to 1000 spores/m(2), the interior surfaces of the Atlas V PLF were extremely clean, housing a mere 4.65 spores/m(2). Reported here are the practices and results of the campaign to implement and verify planetary protection measures on the Atlas V launch vehicle and associated ground support systems used to launch MSL. All these facilities and systems were very well kept and exceeded the levels of cleanliness and rigor required in launching the MSL payload.

TI  - On the role of clouds in the fair weather part of the global electric circuit
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
LA  - English
AB  - Clouds in the fair weather return path of the global electric circuit (GEC) reduce conductivity because of the limited mobility of charge due to attachment to cloud water droplets, effectively leading to a loss of ions. A high-resolution GEC model, which numerically solves the current continuity equation in combination with Ohm's law, is used to show that return currents partially flow around clouds, with current divergence above the cloud and convergence below the cloud. An analysis of this effect is presented for various types of clouds, i. e., for different altitude extents and for different horizontal dimensions, finding that the effect is most pronounced for high clouds with a diameter below 100 km. Based on these results, a method to calculate column and global resistance is developed that can account for all cloud sizes and altitudes. The CESM1(WACCM) (Community Earth System Model-Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model) as well as ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) cloud data are used to calculate the effect of this phenomenon on global resistance. From CESM1(WACCM), it is found that when including clouds in the estimate of resistance the global resistance increases by up to 73 %, depending on the parameters used. Using ISCCP cloud cover leads to an even larger increase, which is likely to be overestimated because of time averaging of cloud cover. Neglecting current divergence/convergence around small clouds overestimates global resistance by up to 20% whereas the method introduced by previous studies underestimates global resistance by up to 40 %. For global GEC models, a conductivity parameterization is developed to account for the current divergence/convergence phenomenon around clouds. Conductivity simulations from CESM1(WACCM) using this parameterization are presented.

AB  - In this paper we study the hyperbolic geometry on a genus 2 surface. The main object of study is a subset of the set of hyperbolic lengths of closed geodesics on such a surface which arises from an algorithmic choice of shortest loops. Maskit has shown that this data can be used to identify finite sided polyhedral fundamental set for the modular group on the marked hyperbolic surface structures of a given genus. The special nature of genus 2 has made it more accessible than in higher genus and we are able to produce a more detailed picture of the domain and its side-pairing transformations. If the domain can be shown to satisfy certain basic topological criteria, according to a classical theorem of Poincare, then this would give a set of geometrical generators and relations for the modular group.

AB  - In this paper, we develop a design methodology for information granulation-based genetically optimized fuzzy inference system, which deals with the tuning method with a variant identification ratio for structural as well as parametric optimization of the reasoning system. The tuning is carried out with the aid of the hierarchical fair competition-based parallel genetic algorithms and it employs the mechanism of information granulation. This version of the genetic algorithm is a multi-population variant of parallel genetic algorithms, which is particularly suitable for handling multimodal problems of high-dimensionality. The granulation of information is realized with the aid of the C-Means clustering algorithm. The concept of information granulation is applied to the formation of the fuzzy inference system in order to realize its structural optimization. Here we divide the input space in order to construct the premise part of the fuzzy rules. Subsequently the consequence part of each fuzzy rule is organized based on the center points (prototypes) of data group obtained as a result of clustering. In particular, this concerns the fuzzy inference system-related parameters, i.e., the number of input variables to be used in the fuzzy inference system, a collection of a specific subset of input variables. the number of membership functions used for each input variable, and the polynomial type (order) occurring at the consequence part of fuzzy rules. Making use of a mechanism of simultaneous tuning for the parameters, we construct an optimized fuzzy inference system related to its structural as well as parametric optimization. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed methodology leads to improved results when compared with some conventional methods exploited in fuzzy modeling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ground-based measurements of the atmospheric conduction current density were conducted on Mount Hermon in northern Israel (33 degrees 18'N 35 degrees 47.2'E, 2050 m a.s.l). The aim was to measure the conduction current diurnal behavior during days that are defined meteorologically as fair weather days. Results from 86 selected fair weather days show an average value of 0.9 pA/m(2) downward, and a double oscillation behavior of the conduction current density with two maxima - a morning peak due to local effect and an evening peak due to global effect, with lower values in between. Fourier transform analysis applied to the continuous data shows the two maxima peaks under the daily background level. The conduction current density, together with the fair weather vertical electric field was used to calculate the fair weather mean conductivity behavior (based on Ohm's law). The conductivity shows minimum values during local noon hours when the station is assumed to be within the boundary layer and high conductivity values during the night hours when the station is above the boundary layer. This is likely due to the respective diurnal changes in concentrations of aerosol particles. A WRF simulation of a single fair weather day was conducted in order to determine the meteorological regime and the boundary layer height and is presented to support the hypothesis that conductivity values depend, at least in part, on the height of the boundary layer relative to the station.

AB  - In this work, the elliptic flow coefficients for charged pions, kaons and protons as a function of transverse momentum pT, at midrapidity (-0.5 < y < 0.5), in Au-Au collisions at three colliding energies (root sNN = 3, 5 and 7.7 GeV) simulated with UrQMD and AMPT-SM (AMPT with string melting version) codes are presented. The scaling of v(2) with the number of valence quarks (n(q)) has been studied as a function of transverse kinetic energy per quark, KET/n(q). A deviation from quark-number scaling is observed at larger values of KET/n(q) in non-central Au-Au collisions for both simulation codes. The 7.7 GeV Au-Au simulated results were compared with STAR experimental data.

AB  - Data-intensive science communities are progressively adopting FAIR practices that enhance the visibility of scientific breakthroughs and enable reuse. At the core of this movement, research objects contain and describe scientific information and resources in a way compliant with the FAIR principles and sustain the development of key infrastructure and tools. This paper provides an account of the challenges, experiences and solutions involved in the adoption of FAIR around research objects over several Earth Science disciplines. During this journey, our work has been comprehensive, with outcomes including: an extended research object model adapted to the needs of earth scientists; the provisioning of digital object identifiers (DOI) to enable persistent identification and to give due credit to authors; the generation of content-based, semantically rich, research object metadata through natural language processing, enhancing visibility and reuse through recommendation systems and third-party search engines; and various types of checklists that provide a compact representation of research object quality as a key enabler of scientific reuse. All these results have been integrated in ROHub, a platform that provides research object management functionality to a wealth of applications and interfaces across different scientific communities. To monitor and quantify the community uptake of research objects, we have defined indicators and obtained measures via ROHub that are also discussed herein. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Event-by-event fluctuations of multiplicity and transverse momentum of charged hadrons produced in heavy-ion collisions at FAIR energies, 10A, 20A, 30A, and 40A GeV are studied in the framework of relativistic transport model, URQMD. Dependence of two families of strongly intensive measures of multiplicity(N) and transverse momentum (p(T)) fluctuations, Delta[p(T), N] and Sigma[p(T), N], on collision centrality, centrality bin-widths and pseudorapidity windows are examined. Attempts are also made to study NN, Np-T, and p(T)p(T) fluctuations using two window analysis method. The findings suggest that the measure, Delta[p(T), N] be dealt with proper selection of centrality intervals. This measure also exhibits a strong dependence on the widths of eta windows. The variable Sigma[p(T), N], however, is observed to be insensitive to the centrality bin-widths and shows a variation of <5% with the widths of eta windows. The analysis of data after event mixing gives Delta[p(T), N] and Sigma[p(T), N] values as similar to 1 irrespective of the widths of eta windows and collision centrality, as predicted by a model of independent particle emission, IPM. The study of joint fluctuations of the two quantities on two eta windows separated in eta space, reveals that Sigma[N-F, N-B] values are similar to 1 irrespective of the position of eta windows whereas, the values of and firstly increase with eta(sep) and later acquire saturations. The observed trend of centrality dependence of and agrees fairly well with those observed in MC simulated studies carried out for AA collisions at LHC energies in the framework model of string fusion.

AB  - Statistically significant (at the 95% significance level) changes in daily cloud cover are found to occur globally over land coincident with extreme increases in 'fair-weather' measurements of vertical electric field (E-z) measured at Vostok, Antarctica. Using global cloud products from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) D1 data series, superposed epoch analyses were made of both increases and decreases in E-z. Field significance testing revealed that, both before and after extreme increases in E-z, significant absolute cloud cover changes (of 13-15%) occur in the tropics and high latitudes. While the linkages in the tropics may reflect changes in the main convective cloud generators of current flow in the global circuit, the linkages at high latitudes appear to represent responses of clouds to the current flow. This linkage offers a possible explanation of a possible solar-terrestrial climate amplification mechanism. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The permittivity wave and altimetry (PWA) instrument is a part of the CASSINI/HUYGENS HASI experiment and was designed to determine the electrical parameters of the atmosphere of Titan in 2004. In December 1995, a balloon campaign was conducted in Leon, Spain, to test the HASI onboard hardware and software using a HUYGENS probe mock-up in an electromagnetic-disturbance-free environment (mainly from power emission lines at 50 Hz). This work is concerned with the measurements of small ion polar conductivities and DC fields using the PWA relaxation probes (RP). The two RP electrodes were periodically set to +/-5 V relative to the conductive surface of the mock-up and allowed to discharge in the surrounding atmosphere, The polar components of conductivity are calculated from the discharge time, and the DC field from the floating potential differences once the electrodes reach equilibrium. In spite of some observed effects, such as mock-up charging or oscillations in the measurement of potential, the conductivity measurements are coherent and in good agreement with the obtained results in other experiments. The conductivity data were collected in 'fair-weather' conditions, up to 30 km during a 4-h flight, every 72 s, giving an attitude resolution better than 400 m. We also discuss the DC field data that do not lead, in presence of charging effects, to a straightforward measurement of the natural DC field. The Comas Sold balloon flight, first real test of the PWA experiment in the terrestrial atmosphere, confirmed the validity of the ionic conductivity measurements but raised the problem of a reliable interpretation of the DC field.

AB  - The possibility of measuring the proton electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region at FAIR with the (P) over bar ANDA detector is discussed. Detailed simulations on signal efficiency for the annihilation of p + p into a lepton pair as well as for the most important background channels have been performed. It is shown that precise measurements of the differential cross-section of the reaction (p) over bar + p -> e(-) + e(+) can be obtained in a wide kinematical range. The determination of the ratio R of the moduli of the electric and magnetic proton form factors will be possible up to a value of momentum transfer squared of q(2) similar or equal to 14 (GeV/c)(2) with absolute precision from 0.01 to 0.5 (for R similar to 1). The total (p) over bar + p -> e(-) + e(+) cross-section will be measured up to q(2) similar or equal to 28 (GeV/c)(2). The results obtained from simulated events are compared to the existing data. Sensitivity to the two-photon exchange mechanism is also investigated.

AB  - In response to growing evidence linking food insecurity and poor nutrition to an increased risk of chronic health problems, such as diabetes and malnutrition, food bank personnel and policy makers must proactively seek new policies and practices that combat food insecurity and ensure that food bank systems function equitably and efficiently. We develop a framework for optimizing resource allocation by food banks among the agencies they serve. Our framework explicitly considers measures of the effectiveness and efficiency of the resource allocation problem faced by food banks, and it implicitly considers an equity performance measure. We measure effectiveness based on the nutritional value of the allocation decisions, efficiency as the utility of the agencies served, and equity as fairness in the allocation of food among those agencies. Specifically, we develop a dynamic programming model in which the primary decision is how much of each product to allocate/distribute to each agency. To deal with the highdimensional state space in the dynamic program, we construct approximations to the value function that are parameterized by a small number of parameters. Computational experiments using real-world data obtained from a food bank in New York State, which serves about 19,0 0 0 individuals per week, are used to evaluate the performance of our approach. When compared against the policy currently in use, our algorithm demonstrated a 7.73% improvement in total utility. Furthermore, when compared against the offline model, where randomness is revealed upfront, the gap between our algorithm and the offline model was less than 9.50%. On the effectiveness side, our framework demonstrated a 3.0% improvement in the nutrition of the served population. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prior work has shown that preschoolers divide resources fairly and expect others to do the same. The majority of research, however, has focused on how children make distributions with respect to number. Here we explore whether preschoolers attend to the value of the objects being shared. We presented four-year-olds and five-year-olds with two puppets and four stickers of different values to split between them. Our central question was whether children would share more valuable stickers with their preferred puppets. In Experiments 1-2, value was induced by making one sticker rarer than the others. In Experiments 3-4, value was measured subjectively (by asking the child which sticker s/he personally preferred). Across all experiments, children made fair numerical splits, but showed favoritism according to value. This work supports the hypothesis that young children coordinate number and value to show both fairness and favoritism when making resource distributions.

AB  - Forecasting the full distribution of the number of earthquakes is revealed to be inherently superior to forecasting their mean. Forecasting the full distribution of earthquake numbers is also shown to yield robust projections in the presence of surprise large earthquakes, which in the past have strongly deteriorated the scores of existing models. We show this with pseudoprospective experiments on synthetic as well as real data from the Advanced National Seismic System database for California, with earthquakes with magnitude larger than 2.95 that occurred between the period 1971 and 2016. Our results call in question the testing methodology of the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP), which amounts to assuming a Poisson distribution of earthquake numbers, which is known to be a poor representation of the heavy-tailed distribution of earthquake numbers. Using a spatially varying epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, we demonstrate a remarkable stability of the forecasting performance, when using the full distribution of earthquake numbers for the forecasts, even in the presence of large earthquakes such as M-w 7.1 Hector Mine, M-w 7.2 El MayorCucapah, M-w 6.6 Sam Simeon earthquakes, or in the presence of intense swarm activity in northwest Nevada in 2014. Although our results have been derived for ETAS-type models, we propose that all earthquake forecasting models of any type should embrace the full distribution of earthquake numbers, such that their true forecasting potential is revealed.

AB  - Animal agglomerations at commercial events such as trade fairs represent an important facilitator in infectious disease transmission. Thus, it is crucial to understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases in small ruminants. The objective of this study was to examine lentiviral presence in goats and sheep traded at the animal fair of Tabira city (Sertao region of Pernambuco) and identify possible risk factors associated with infection. We collected serum samples from 233 crossbred goats and 119 crossbred sheep, belonging to 12 breeders, at the Tabira livestock fair from November 2014 to June 2015. An epidemiological questionnaire was used to analyze the risk factors. Agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and western blotting (WB) were performed to diagnose small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infection. In the AGID test, we used maedi-visna virus (MVV) antigens for sheep and caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus (strain Cork) (CAEV-Co) antigen for goats. The WB analysis used CAEV-Co antigen for both species. Variables from the questionnaire were analyzed with univariate and multivariate statistics. One seropositive goat but no sheep was identified via AGID. According to the WB results, 15/233 goats (6.44%; CI95% = 3.94 - 10.35%) and 8/119 sheep (6.72%; CI95% = 3.45 - 12.71%) were seropositive, totaling 23/352 reactive animals (6.53%; CI95% = 4.39 - 9.61%) from 12 herds. Annual vermifugation of the animals was a significant risk factor (odds ratio = 5.9; CI95% = 1.7-19.8; p = 0.04) for disease in goats, but no variables associated with infection risks were identified in sheep. We concluded that SRLV was present in goats and sheep at the animal fair. Western blots were more sensitive than AGID for SRLV diagnosis. Practices aiming to improve sanitary management may reduce the risk of infection in goats. All studied herds included animals identified as seropositive for SRLV. Therefore, we recommend adopting measures that increase disease diagnosis while intensifying traffic control and surveillance of animal agglomerations.

AB  - Substantial experimental and theoretical efforts worldwide are devoted to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. At LHC and top RHIC energies, QCD matter is studied at very high temperatures and nearly vanishing net-baryon densities. There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was created at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the hadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities and lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a rich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and partonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like quarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in our understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of various high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD phase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is designed to run at unprecedented interaction rates. High-rate operation is the key prerequisite for high-precision measurements of multi-differential observables and of rare diagnostic probes which are sensitive to the dense phase of the nuclear fireball. The goal of the CBM experiment at SIS100 (root s(NN) = 2.7-4.9 GeV) is to discover fundamental properties of QCD matter: the phase structure at large baryon-chemical potentials (mu(B) > 500 MeV), effects of chiral symmetry, and the equation of state at high density as it is expected to occur in the core of neutron stars. In this article, we review the motivation for and the physics programme of CBM, including activities before the start of data taking in 2024, in the context of the worldwide efforts to explore high-density QCD matter.
