AB  - The unidentified infrared emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 mu m are ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysical regions and commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, the unambiguous identification of any individual, specific PAH molecules has proven elusive until very recently, when two isomers of cyanonapthalene, which consists of two fused benzene rings and substitutes a nitrile (-CN) group for a hydrogen atom, were discovered in the Taurus Molecular Cloud, based on their rotational transitions at radio frequencies. To facilitate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for cyanonapthalenes in astrophysical regions, we model the vibrational excitation of cyanonapthalenes and calculate their infrared emission spectra in a number of representative astrophysical regions. The model emission spectra and intensities will allow JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundances of cyanonapthalenes.

AB  - We report infrared spectral evidence of deuterated interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Two bands are detected in the infrared emission from the ionization bar in Orion at 4.4 and 4.65 mum. The one at 4.65 mum is present at the 4.4 sigma level, while the one at 4.4 mum is more tentative, with a sigma equal to 1.9. An emission band at 4.65 mum is also detected in the infrared emission from M17 by Verstraete and coworkers at the 4.4 sigma level. These wavelengths are highly characteristic of C-D stretching modes of deuterated PAHs and fall in a featureless region of the interstellar spectrum. The IR spectroscopic properties of deuterated PAHs are summarized, and an estimate of the deuterium fractionation between the aromatic and aliphatic carbons associated with the PAHs is given. High deuterium fractionation is implied; this is discussed in terms of interstellar PAH fractionation mechanisms.

AB  - We have obtained new Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph spectra to search for structure in the ultraviolet interstellar extinction curve, with particular emphasis on a search for absorption features produced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The presence of these molecules in the interstellar medium has been postulated to explain the infrared emission features seen in the 3 - 13 mum spectra of numerous sources. Ultraviolet (UV) spectra are uniquely capable of identifying specific PAH molecules. We obtained high signal-to-noise ratio UV spectra of stars that are significantly more reddened than those observed in previous studies. These data put limits on the role of small ( 30 - 50 carbon atoms) PAHs in UV extinction and call for further observations to probe the role of larger PAHs. PAHs are of importance because of their ubiquity and high abundance inferred from the infrared data, and also because they may link the molecular and dust phases of the interstellar medium. A presence or absence of UV absorption bands due to PAHs could be a definitive test of this hypothesis. We should be able to detect a 20 Angstrom wide feature down to a 3 sigma limit of similar to 0.02 A(V). No such absorption features are seen other than the well-known 2175 Angstrom bump.

AB  - We reconsider the contribution that singly protonated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; HPAH(+)s) might make to the Class A component of the 6.2 mu m interstellar emission feature in light of the recent experimental measurements of protonated naphthalene and coronene. Our calculations on the small HPAH(+)s have a band near 6.2 mu m, as found in experiment. While the larger HPAH(+)s still have emission near 6.2 mu m, the much larger intensity of the band near 6.3 mu m overwhelms the weaker band at 6.2 mu m, so that the 6.2 mu m band is barely visible. Since the large PAHs are more representative of those in the interstellar medium, our work suggests that large HPAH(+)s cannot be major contributors to the observed emission at 6.2 mu m (i.e., Class A species). Saturating large PAH cations with hydrogen atoms retains the 6.2 mu m Class A band position, but the rest of the spectrum is inconsistent with observed spectra.

AB  - Computational study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with phenyl side group substituted at different positions is reported. The infrared spectral variations due to the position of phenyl substitution, ionization state and the size of the molecules are discussed and possible contribution of phenyl-PAHs to the mid-infrared emission features from astrophysical objects is analysed. Structurally phenyl group substitution at 2nd position gives more stable species compared to substitution at other positions. Phenyl-PAHs exhibit new aromatic bands near 695 and 741 cm-1 (14.4 and 13.5 mu m), due to contribution from quintet C-H wag, that compare well with minor features at 14.2 and 13.5 mu m observed in several astrophysical objects. Just as in plain PAHs, the C-C stretch vibrational modes (similar to 1600 cm-1) have negligible intensity in neutrals, but the cations of all phenyl-PAHs exhibit significantly strong phenyl group C-C stretch peak close to class B type 6.2 mu m astrophysical band. In 2-phenylpyrene, it is the neutral molecule that exhibits this strong feature in the 6.2 mu m range along with other features that match with sub-features at 6.66 and 6.9 mu m, observed in astronomical spectra of some late type objects. The substitution of phenyl side group at solo position shifts the C-C stretch mode of parent PAH close to the region of 6.2 mu m astrophysical band. The results indicate possibility of phenyl-PAHs in space and the bottom-up formation of medium sized compact PAHs with phenyl side group in carbon rich cool circumstellar shells. Phenyl-PAHs need to be considered in modelling mid-infrared emission spectra of various astrophysical objects.

AB  - Organic compounds, such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are among the major species responsible for the infrared spectral features characterising the cosmic background radiation. Similar to silicate dust, aggregates rich in carbon with micro- and nano-meter sizes are subjected to several weathering processes in various astrophysical environments that modify their chemistry and structure, thus contributing to the chemical richness of the cosmic environment. In particular, the study of the chemical and structural evolution of PAHs aggregates in the presence of water is relevant to understand the mechanism of formation of the prebiotic building blocks of life. Pulsed laser ablation of a water-dispersed nano-phase of rubrene (5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene) is here performed to reproduce the high energy-density conditions occurring in shock events in the interstellar medium, while ensuring the presence of a water environment. We studied the structural and chemical evolution of the dispersed rubrene nanocrystals upon laser treatment, showing that rubrene undergoes a fragmentation process producing water soluble species. The results obtained demonstrate that the extreme conditions occurring in cosmic environments coupled with the presence of water are sufficient conditions for transforming PAHs into prebiotic molecules.

AB  - The mid-infrared spectra of neutral homogeneous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) clusters have been computed using density functional theory including an empirical correction for dispersion. The C-H out-of-plane bending modes are redshifted for all the clusters considered in this work. The magnitude of the redshift and the peak broadening are dependent on PAH size, shape, and on the PAH arrangement in the cluster.

AB  - In this Letter, we report the results of density functional theory calculations on medium-sized neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules with armchair edges. These PAH molecules possess strong C-H stretching and bending modes around 3 mu m and in the fingerprint region (10-15 mu m), and also strong ring deformation modes around 12.7 mu m. Perusal of the entries in the NASA Ames PAHs Database shows that ring deformation modes of PAHs are common, although generally weak. Therefore, we propose that armchair PAHs with N-C > 65 are responsible for the 12.7 mu m aromatic infrared band in Hii regions and discuss the astrophysical implications in the context of the PAH life cycle.

AB  - The fragmentation pathways of C6H6+2 are studied using density functional theory. All of the transition states that were found, excluding the rearrangement to the C-5v structure, are significantly above the six-membered ring structure. This is consistent with the soft ionization experiments that find mostly dication production instead of fragmentation. Since the C-5v structure is probably of limited importance for multiple-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the computed barriers suggest that Coulomb explosion is not a significant channel under most astrophysical conditions, and therefore, the dications are long-lived and should be considered in modeling of the interstellar medium.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have long been suggested to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM). Nevertheless, despite their expected ubiquity and sustained searching efforts, identifying specific interstellar PAH molecules from their infrared (IR) spectroscopy has so far been unsuccessful. However, due to its unprecedented sensitivity, the advent of the JWST may change this. Meanwhile, recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in detecting specific PAH molecules (e.g. indene, cyanoindene, and cyanonaphthalene) through their rotational lines in the radio frequencies. As JWST holds great promise for identifying specific PAH molecules in the ISM based on their vibrational spectra in the IR, in this work, we model the vibrational excitation of indene, a molecule composed of a six-membered benzene ring fused with a five-membered cyclopentene ring, and calculate its IR emission spectra for a number of representative astrophysical regions. This will facilitate JWST to search for and identify indene in space through its vibrational bands and to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on its abundance.

AB  - Recent observations have shown the presence of dust and molecular material in galactic winds, but relatively little is known about the distribution of these outflow components. To shed some light on this issue, we have used IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope archive to investigate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission from a sample of 16 local galaxies with known winds. Our focus on nearby sources (median distance 8.6 Mpc) has revealed detailed PAH structure in the winds and allowed us to measure extraplanar PAH emission. We have identified extraplanar PAH features on scales of similar to 0.8-6.0 kpc. We find a nearly linear correlation between the amount of extraplanar PAH emission and the total infrared flux, a proxy for star formation activity in the disk. Our results also indicate a correlation between the height of extraplanar PAH emission and star formation rate surface density, which supports the idea of a surface density threshold on the energy or momentum injection rate for producing detectable extraplanar wind material.

AB  - We have studied reactions of small dehydrogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon anions with neutral species of interstellar relevance. Reaction rate constants are measured at 300 K for the reactions of phenide (C6H5-), naphthalenide (C10H7-), and anthracenide (C14H9-) with atomic H, H-2, and D-2 using a flowing afterglow-selected ion flow tube instrument. Reaction rate constants of phenide with neutral molecules (CO, O-2, CO2, N2O, C2H2, CH3OH, CH3CN, (CH3)(2)CO, CH3CHO, CH3Cl, and (CH3CH2)(2)O) are also measured under the same conditions. Experimental measurements are accompanied by ab initio calculations to provide insight into reaction pathways and enthalpies. Our measured reaction rate constants should prove useful in the modeling of astrophysical environments, particularly when applied to dense regions of the interstellar and circumstellar medium.

AB  - We examine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), dust, and atomic/molecular emission toward the Galactic bulge using Spitzer Space Telescope observations of four fields: C32, C35, OGLE, and NGC 6522. These fields are approximately centered on (l, b). =. (0 degrees.0, 1 degrees.0), (0 degrees.0, -1 degrees.0), (0 degrees.4, -2 degrees.4), and (1 degrees.0, -3 degrees.8), respectively. Far-infrared photometric observations complement the Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic data and are used to construct spectral energy distributions. We find that the dust and PAH emission are exceptionally similar between C32 and C35 overall, in part explained due to their locations-they reside on or near boundaries of a 7 Myr old Galactic outflow event and are partly shock-heated. Within the C32 and C35 fields, we identify a region of elevated Ha. emission that is coincident with elevated fine-structure and [O IV] line emission and weak PAH feature strengths. We are likely tracing a transition zone of the outflow into the nascent environment. PAH abundances in these fields are slightly depressed relative to typical ISM values. In the OGLE and NGC 6522 fields, we observe weak features on a continuum dominated by zodiacal dust. SED fitting indicates that thermal dust grains in C32 and C35 have temperatures comparable to those of diffuse, high-latitude cirrus clouds. Little variability is detected in the PAH properties between C32 and C35, indicating that a stable population of PAHs dominates the overall spectral appearance. In fact, their PAH features are exceptionally similar to that of the M82 superwind, emphasizing that we are probing a local Galactic wind environment.

AB  - Photo-/ion-induced ionization and dissociation processes are commonly observed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. This work performs theoretical studies of PAHs and their fragments. Molecular dynamics simulations in combination with static quantum chemical calculations reveal that following a single hydrogen atom loss, the fragments, PAH-H, are extremely reactive. They catch a neighbor molecule within picoseconds to form a covalently bonded large molecule regardless of orientations/angles and temperatures. We calculate the infrared spectra of the covalently bonded molecules, which indicate that such species could be the carrier of unidentified infrared emission bands. It also implies that regular PAHs might be less abundant in space than what is expected.

AB  - Observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope have drawn attention to spectroscopic structure longward of 15 mm that is associated with objects showing prominent unidentified infrared (UIR) bands in the mid-IR. If polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are indeed responsible for the UIR features, longer wavelength emission arising from out-of-plane PAH skeletal vibrations is required. Here we compare some of the Spitzer spectra with spectra from the Infrared Space Observatory and analyze these data in terms of the PAH model utilizing the spectra of neutral PAHs from the Ames PAH IR spectral database. The 14 - 21 mum emission spectra from the H II region S106, the young stellar object CD - 42degrees 11721, the reflection nebula NGC 7023, and the H-2 ridge in LkHalpha 234 are presented. We show that while the emission in this region can be quite variable, the bulk of these variations can be accommodated by variations in PAH population.

AB  - Context. This is the fourth in a series of papers based on the ISOCAM Parallel Survey at 6.7 mu m. While the first three papers have been devoted to active galactic nuclei (AGN), here we report on emission-line galaxies without AGN signatures in their optical spectra.
   Aims. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission has been found in both starbursts and modestly starforming galaxies, but the relation between starforming activity and PAH luminosity is still a matter of debate. The different correlation degrees could be caused by the variety of optical and far-infrared sample selection criteria. In order to obtain a census of the typical properties of PAH emitting galaxies, we here study moderately distant galaxies which have been selected by their PAH emission.
   Methods. Combining the ISOCAM Parallel Survey at 6.7 mu m with 2MASS we have colour-selected a sample of 120 candidates for strong PAH emission. We obtained optical and mid-infrared spectra of 75 and 19 sources, respectively, and analysed IRAS-ADDSCANs and available Spitzer 3.6-160 mu m photometry.
   Results. The Spitzer mid-infrared spectra exhibit clear PAH features and corroborate that our photometric selection criteria trace the PAH emission of galaxies fairly well. The optical spectra show emission lines, at median redshift z similar to 0.1, as well as H(delta) and Ca II absorption, indicating ongoing starformation as well as post-starbursts. The mid-and far-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) provide evidence for a broad range of far-infrared (FIR) luminosities (10(9) L(circle dot)-2x10(12) L(circle dot)), but in general the dust is colder (T less than or similar to 25 K, beta = 2) than for starburst galaxies like M 82 (T approximate to 40 K). For most galaxies the monocromatic luminosity (v . L(v)) peaks at about equal height at optical, 6.7 mu m (PAH) and FIR wavelengths. In about 15% of the sources the FIR luminosity exceeds the optical and PAH energy output by about a factor 5-10 despite the cool dust temperature; in these galaxies a large dust mass of 10(8)-10(9) M(circle dot) is inferred.
   Conclusions. At moderate distance (z similar to 0.1), PAH selected galaxies turn out to be a quite heterogeneous population of dust-rich, partly infrared-luminous galaxies but mostly cool with a range of post-starburst signatures and starforming activity which appears to be rather modest relative to the entire gas content (derived from the dust mass and assuming a standard gas/dust ratio). Our results on PAH selected galaxies question the often expressed interpretation that the majority of high redshift galaxies detected in 15 and 24 mu m surveys are dominated by powerful ongoing starbursts with high starforming efficiency.

AB  - The far-IR characteristics of astrophysically relevant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) averaging in size around 100 carbon atoms have been studied using the theoretical spectra in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database. These spectra were calculated using density functional theory. Selections of PAH species are made, grouped together by common characteristics or trends, such as size, shape, charge, and composition, and their far-IR spectra compared. The out-of-plane modes involving the entire molecule are explored in detail, astronomical relevance is assessed, and an observing strategy is discussed. It is shown that PAHs produce richer far-IR spectra with increasing size. PAHs also produce richer far-IR spectra with increasing number of irregularities. However, series of irregular-shaped PAHs with the same compact core have common "Jumping-Jack" modes that "pile up" at specific frequencies in their average spectrum. For the PAHs studied here, around 100 carbon atoms in size, this band falls near 50 mu m. PAH charge and nitrogen inclusion affect band intensities but have little effect on far-IR band positions. Detailed analysis of the two-dimensional, out-of-plane bending "drumhead" modes in the coronene and pyrene "families" and the one-dimensional, out-of-plane bending "bar" modes in the acene "family" show that these molecular vibrations can be treated as classical vibrating sheets and bars of graphene, respectively. The analysis also shows that the peak position of these modes is very sensitive to the area of the emitting PAH and does not depend on the particular geometry. Thus, these longest wavelength PAH bands could provide a unique handle on the size of the largest species in the interstellar PAH family. However, these bands are weak. Observing highly excited regions showing the mid-IR bands in which the emission from classical dust peaks at short wavelengths offers the best chance of detecting PAH emission in the far-IR. For these regions sensitivity is not an issue, spectral contrast is maximized and the PAH population is only comprised of highly stable, compact symmetric PAHs, such as the members of the pyrene and coronene "families" discussed in detail here.

AB  - Here we report the computed far-infrared (FIR) spectra of neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules containing at least 82 carbons up to 130 carbons and with shapes going from compact round and oval-type structures to rectangular and to trapezoidal. The effects of size and shape on the FIR band positions and intensities are discussed. Using FIR data from the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database Version 1.1, we generate synthetic spectra that support the suggestion that the 16.4, 17.4, and 17.8 mu m bands arise from PAHs.

AB  - We present a new method to accurately describe the ionization fraction and the size distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) within astrophysical sources. To this purpose, we have computed the mid-infrared emission spectra of 308 PAH molecules of varying sizes, symmetries, and compactness, generated in a range of radiation fields. We show that the intensity ratio of the solo CH out-of-plane bending mode in PAH cations and anions (referred to as the '11.0' mu m band, falling in the 11.0-11.3 mu m region for cations and anions) to their 3.3 mu m emission scales with PAH size, similarly to the scaling of the 11.2/3.3 ratio with the number of carbon atoms (N-C) for neutral molecules. Among the different PAH emission hands, it is the 3.3 mu m band intensity that has the strongest correlation with N-C, and drives the reported PAH intensity ratio correlations with N-C for both neutral and ionized PAHs. The 6.2/7.7 intensity ratio, previously adopted to track PAH size, shows no evident scaling with N-C in our large sample. We define a new diagnostic grid space to probe PAH charge and size, using the (11.2 + 11.0)/7.7 and (11.2 + 11.0)/3.3 PAH intensity ratios, respectively. We demonstrate the application of the (11.2 + 11.0)/7.7-(11.2 + 11.0)/3.3 diagnostic grid for galaxies M82 and NGC 253, for the planetary nebula NGC 7027, and the reflection nebulae NGC 2023 and NGC 7023. Finally, we provide quantitative relations for PAH size determination depending on the ionization fraction of the PAHs and the radiation field they are exposed to.

AB  - Meteorites contain bio-relevant molecules such as vitamins and nucleobases, which consist of aromatic structures with embedded nitrogen atoms. Questions remain over the chemical mechanisms responsible for the formation of nitrogen-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PANHs) in extraterrestrial environments. By exploiting single collision conditions, we show that a radical mediated bimolecular collision between pyridyl radicals and 1,3-butadiene in the gas phase forms nitrogen-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PANHs) 1,4-dihydroquinoline and to a minor amount 1,4-dihydroisoquinoline. The reaction proceeds through the formation of a van der Waals complex, which circumnavigates the entrance barrier implying it can operate at very low kinetic energy and therefore at low temperatures of 10 K as present in cold molecular clouds such as TMC-1. The discovery of facile de facto barrierless exoergic reaction mechanisms leading to PANH formation could play an important role in providing a population of aromatic structures upon which further photo-processing of ice condensates could occur to form nucleobases.

AB  - We present an alternate model for the formation of molecular hydrogen in the interstellar medium (ISM) where polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) cations may play a key role as catalysts. The mechanism involves the chemical trapping of H atoms on the periphery of the PAH carbon skeleton and the subsequent release of H(2) through dissociative recombination of the hydrogenated ion with an electron. The estimated rate coefficient of H(2) production using this process compares well with a widely accepted value of 3 x 10(-17) cm(3) s(-1) for H(2) formation on grains in the diffuse ISM. It is inferred that PAHs can contribute significantly to the formation of molecular hydrogen, especially in environments where the classical process of H adsorption on grains is impeded by high UV fluxes as in diffuse clouds and photon-dominated regions.

AB  - Superhydrogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may be present in H-rich and ultraviolet-poor benign regions. The addition of excess H atoms to PAHs converts the aromatic bonds into aliphatic bonds, the strongest of which falls near 3.4 mu m. Therefore, superhydrogenated PAHs are often hypothesized to be a carrier of the 3.4 mu m emission feature that typically accompanies the stronger 3.3 mu m aromatic C-H stretching feature. To assess this hypothesis, we use density function theory to compute the infrared (IR) vibrational spectra of superhydrogenated PAHs and their ions of various sizes (ranging from benzene and naphthalene to perylene and coronene) and of various degrees of hydrogenation. For each molecule, we derive the intrinsic oscillator strengths of the 3.3 mu m aromatic C-H stretch (A(3.3)) and the 3.4 mu m aliphatic C-H stretch (A(3.4)). By comparing the computationally derived mean ratio of < A(3.4)/A(3.3)> approximate to 1.98 with the mean ratio of the observed intensities < I-3.4/I-3.3 > approximate to 0.12, we find that the degree of superhydrogenation-the fraction of carbon atoms attached with extra hydrogen atoms-is only similar to 2.2% for neutral PAHs, which predominantly emit the 3.3 and 3.4 mu m features. We also determine for each molecule the intrinsic band strengths of the 6.2 mu m aromatic C-C stretch (A(6.2)) and the 6.85 mu m aliphatic C-H deformation (A(6.85)). We derive the degree of superhydrogenation from the mean ratio of the observed intensities < I-6.85/I-6.2 > less than or similar to 0.10 and < A(6.85)/A(6.2)> approximate to 1.53 for neutrals and < A(6.85)/A(6.2)>= approximate to 0.56 for cations to be less than or similar to 3.1% for neutrals and less than or similar to 8.6% for cations. We conclude that astrophysical PAHs are primarily aromatic and are only marginally superhydrogenated.

AB  - We present Spitzer observations of Ly alpha blobs (LABs) at z = 2.38-3.09. The mid-infrared ratios (4.5 mu m/8 mu m and 8 mu m/24 mu m) indicate that similar to 60% of LAB infrared counterparts are cool, consistent with their infrared output being dominated by star formation and not active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The rest have a substantial hot dust component that one would expect from an AGN or an extreme starburst. Comparing the mid-infrared to submillimeter fluxes (similar to 850 mu m or rest-frame far-infrared) also indicates that a large percentage (similar to 2/3) of the LAB counterparts have total bolometric energy output dominated by star formation, although the number of sources with submillimeter detections or meaningful upper limits remains small (similar to 10). We obtained Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra of six infrared-bright sources associated with LABs. Four of these sources have measurable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features, indicative of significant star formation, while the remaining two show a featureless continuum, indicative of infrared energy output completely dominated by an AGN. Two of the counterparts with PAHs are mixed sources, with PAH line-to-continuum ratios and PAH equivalent widths indicative of large energy contributions from both star formation and AGN. Most of the LAB infrared counterparts have large stellar masses, around 10(11)M(circle dot). There is a weak trend of mass upper limit with the Ly alpha luminosity of the host blob, particularly after the most likely AGN contaminants are removed. The range in likely energy sources for the LABs found in this and previous studies suggests that there is no single source of power that is producing all the known LABs.

AB  - Emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a commonly used indicator of star formation activity in galaxies, also has the potential to serve as an effective empirical tracer of molecular gas. We use a sample of 19 nearby galaxies with spatially resolved mid-infrared Spitzer spectroscopy, multiwavelength optical and mid-infrared imaging, and millimeter interferometric CO(1-0) maps to investigate the feasibility of using PAH emission as an empirical proxy to estimate molecular gas mass. PAH emission correlates strongly with CO emission on subkiloparsec scales over the diverse environments probed by our sample of star-forming galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. The tight observed correlation, likely a consequence of photoelectronic heating of the diffuse interstellar gas by the PAHs, permits us to derive an empirical calibration to estimate molecular gas mass from the luminosity of PAH emission that has a total scatter of only similar to 0.2-0.25 dex. Mid-infrared bands sensitive to PAH emission (e.g., the Spitzer/IRAC4 and WISE/W3 filters) can also be used as a highly effective substitute for this purpose.

AB  - Since the discovery of interstellar infrared emission features in the 3.3-12.7 mum wavelength range three decades ago, the carriers of these features have been the subject of much debate. Recent observational work with the Infrared Space Observatory, experimental work, and quantum chemical calculations concerning positively charged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules point to the infrared fluorescence of such species. This paper presents a model of the interstellar infrared emission between 3.3 and 12.7 mum from a population of symmetric, condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons composed of up to 54 carbon atoms. We describe the infrared emission intensity in terms of the size of the emitting molecule, its charge, and its temperature probability distribution function. The model takes the charge state (anion, neutral, cation of charge state up to +3) into account self-consistently, employing the most recent quantum chemically calculated infrared cross sections of such species. This paper provides an exploratory study to illustrate the dependence of the interstellar infrared emission on the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon charge distribution. We conclude that the charge state of the PAH has an important effect on the emitted infrared spectrum. The 3.3 mum stretching mode and, to a lesser extent, the 11-15 km C-H out-of-plane bending modes produce significant emission relative to the other infrared features and originate predominantly from neutral and anionic PAHs. The 6-8 mum emission from the C-C stretching modes, in contrast, originates mainly from charged PAHs with only a partial contribution from neutrals. For heavily ultraviolet irradiated regions such as the Orion Bar, multiply positively charged PAHs are the norm and contribute significantly in this wavelength region. However, because the total infrared emission is a sum over various charge states of different molecules, the ratios of the infrared emission bands do not vary much for G(o)/n(e) less than or equal to 10(3) cm(3). This range includes conditions relevant to both the diffuse interstellar medium and typical reflection nebulae. Larger variations in the interstellar infrared emission features can be expected from photodissociation regions associated with dense H II regions such as the Orion Bar (G(o)/n(e) similar to 10(4)).

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous in astrophysical environments, as revealed by their pronounced emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 mu m commonly ascribed to the C-H and C-C vibrational modes. Although these features have long been predicted to be polarized, previous searches for PAH polarization led to null or, at best, tentative detections. Here we report the definite detection of polarized PAH emission at 11.3 mu m in the nebula associated with the Herbig Be star MWC 1080. We measure a polarization degree of 1.9% +/- 0.2%, which is unexpectedly high compared to models. This poses a challenge in the current understanding of the alignment of PAHs, which is required to polarize the PAH emission but thought to be substantially suppressed. PAH alignment with a magnetic field via a resonance paramagnetic relaxation process may account for such a high level of polarization.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the strong unidentified emission near 3.28 mu m in Titan's upper daytime atmosphere recently discovered by Dinelli et al. We have studied it by using the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), after absorbing UV solar radiation, are able to emit strongly near 3.3 mu m. By using current models for the redistribution of the absorbed UV energy, we have explained the observed spectral feature and have derived the vertical distribution of PAH abundances in Titan's upper atmosphere. PAHs have been found to be present in large concentrations, about (2-3) x 10(4) particles cm(-3). The identified PAHs have 9-96 carbons, with a concentration-weighted average of 34 carbons. The mean mass is similar to 430 u; the mean area is about 0.53 nm(2); they are formed by 10-11 rings on average, and about one-third of them contain nitrogen atoms. Recently, benzene together with light aromatic species as well as small concentrations of heavy positive and negative ions have been detected in Titan's upper atmosphere. We suggest that the large concentrations of PAHs found here are the neutral counterpart of those positive and negative ions, which hence supports the theory that the origin of Titan main haze layer is located in the upper atmosphere.

AB  - We discuss the proposal of relating the origin of some of the diffuse interstellar absorption bands (DIBs) to neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in translucent interstellar clouds. An assessment of ionized PAHs will be examined in a future report. The spectra of several cold, isolated gas-phase PAHs have been measured in the laboratory under experimental conditions that mimic the interstellar conditions and are compared with an extensive set of astronomical spectra of reddened, early-type stars. This comparison provides-for the first time-accurate upper limits for the abundances of specific PAH molecules along specific lines of sight, something not attainable from IR observations alone. The comparison of these unique laboratory data with high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra leads to two major findings: (1) a finding specific to the individual molecules that were probed in this study and, which leads to the clear and unambiguous conclusion that the abundance of these specific neutral PAHs must be very low in the individual translucent interstellar clouds that were probed in this survey (PAH features remain below the level of detection) and, (2) a general finding that neutral PAHs exhibit intrinsic band profiles that are similar to the profile of the narrow DIBs indicating that the carriers of the narrow DIBs must have close molecular structure and characteristics. This study is the first quantitative survey of neutral PAHs in the optical range and it opens the way for unambiguous quantitative searches of PAHs in a variety of interstellar and circumstellar environments.

AB  - The astronomical emission features, formerly known as the unidentified infrared bands, are now commonly ascribed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The laboratory experiments and computational modeling done at the NASA Ames Research Center to create a collection of PAH IR spectra relevant to test and refine the PAH hypothesis have been assembled into a spectroscopic database. This database now contains over 800 PAH spectra spanning 2-2000 mu m (5000-5 cm(-1)). These data are now available on the World Wide Web at www.astrochem.org/pahdb. This paper presents an overview of the computational spectra in the database and the tools developed to analyze and interpret astronomical spectra using the database. A description of the online and offline user tools available on the Web site is also presented.

AB  - The mid-infrared spectra of dense photodissociation regions (PDRs) are typically dominated by emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the lowest pure rotational states of molecular hydrogen (H-2), the two species which are probes of the physical properties of gas and dust in intense UV radiation fields. We utilize the high angular resolution of the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope to construct spectral maps of the PAH and H-2 features for three of the best-studied PDRs in the galaxy, NGC 7023, NGC 2023, and IC 63. We present spatially resolved maps of the physical properties, including the H-2 ortho-to-para ratio, temperature, and G(o)/n(H). We also present evidence for PAH dehydrogenation, which may support theories of H-2 formation on PAH surfaces, and a detection of preferential self-shielding of ortho-H-2. All PDRs studied exhibit average temperatures of similar to 500-800 K, warm H-2 column densities of similar to 10(20) cm(-2), G(o)/n(H) similar to 0.1-0.8, and ortho-to-para ratios of similar to 1.8. We find that while the average of each of these properties is consistent with previous single value measurements of these PDRs, when available, the addition of spatial resolution yields a diversity of values with gas temperatures as high as 1500 K, column densities spanning similar to 2 orders of magnitude, and extreme ortho-to-para ratios (R-OP) of R-OP < 1 and R-OP > 3.

AB  - We present a new methodology for simulating mid-infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in galaxy evolution simulations. To do this, we combine theoretical models of PAH emission features as they respond to varying interstellar radiation fields, grain-size distributions, and ionization states with a new model for dust evolution in galaxy simulations. We apply these models to three idealized arepo galaxy evolution simulations within the smuggle physics framework. We use these simulations to develop numerical experiments investigating the buildup of PAH masses and luminosities in galaxies in idealized analogs of the Milky Way, a dwarf galaxy, and a starburst disk. Our main results are as follows. Galaxies with high specific star formation rates have increased feedback energy per unit mass, and are able to shatter grains efficiently, driving up the fraction of ultrasmall grains. At the same time, in our model large radiation fields per unit gas density convert aliphatic grains into aromatics. The fraction of dust grains in the form of PAHs (q (PAH)) can be understood as a consequence of these processes, and in our model PAHs form primarily from interstellar processing (shattering) of larger grains rather than from the growth of smaller grains. We find that the hardness of the radiation field plays a larger role than variations in the grain-size distribution in setting the total integrated PAH luminosities, though cosmological simulations are necessary to investigate fully the complex interplay of processes that drive PAH band luminosities in galaxies.

AB  - We study the effect of anisotropic radiation illumination on the alignment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and report that the cross-sectional mechanism of alignment earlier considered in terms of gas-grain interactions can also be efficient for the photon-grain interaction. We demonstrate this by first calculating the angle-dependence rotational damping and excitation coefficients by photon absorption followed by infrared emission. We then calculate the degree of PAH alignment for the different environments and physical parameters, including the illumination direction, ionization fraction, and magnetic field strength. For the reflection nebula (RN) conditions with unidirectional radiation field, we find that the degree of alignment tends to increase with increasing angle psi between the illumination direction and the magnetic field, as a result of the decrease of the cross section of photon absorption with psi. We calculate the polarization of spinning PAH emission using the obtained degree of alignment for the different physical parameters, assuming constant grain temperatures. We find that the polarization of spinning PAH emission from RNe can be large, between 5% and 20% at frequencies nu > 20 GHz, whereas the polarization is less than 3% for photodissociation regions. In realistic conditions, the polarization is expected to be lower owing to grain temperature fluctuations and magnetic field geometry. The polarization for the diffuse cold neutral medium is rather low, below 1% at nu > 20 GHz, consistent with observations by WMAP and Planck. Our results demonstrate that the RNe are the favored environment to observe the polarization of spinning dust emission and polarized mid-IR emission from PAHs.

AB  - We present new observations of the central 1 kpc of the M82 starburst obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared camera instrument at a resolution theta similar to 0.'' 05-0.'' 1 (similar to 1-2 pc). The data comprises images in three mostly continuum filters (F140M, F250M, and F360M), and filters that contain [Fe ii] (F164N), H2 v = 1 -> 0 (F212N), and the 3.3 mu m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature (F335M). We find prominent plumes of PAH emission extending outward from the central starburst region, together with a network of complex filamentary substructures and edge-brightened bubble-like features. The structure of the PAH emission closely resembles that of the ionized gas, as revealed in Paschen alpha and free-free radio emission. We discuss the origin of the structure, and suggest the PAHs are embedded in a combination of neutral, molecular, and photoionized gas.

AB  - We present a comparison of theoretical predictions of dust continuum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission with new JWST observations in three nearby galaxies: NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496. Our analysis focuses on a total of 1063 compact stellar clusters and 2654 stellar associations previously characterized by the Hubble Space Telescope in the three galaxies. We find that the distributions and trends in the observed PAH-focused infrared colors generally agree with theoretical expectations, and that the bulk of the observations is more aligned with models of larger, ionized PAHs. These JWST data usher in a new era of probing interstellar dust and studying how the intense radiation fields near stellar clusters and associations play a role in shaping the physical properties of PAHs.

AB  - In this work we report on high-resolution IR absorption studies that provide a detailed view on how the peripheral structure of irregular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) affects the shape and position of their 3 mu m absorption band. For this purpose, we present mass-selected, high-resolution absorption spectra of cold and isolated phenanthrene, pyrene, benz[a]antracene, chrysene, triphenylene, and perylene molecules in the 2950-3150 cm(-1) range. The experimental spectra are compared with standard harmonic calculations and anharmonic calculations using a modified version of the SPECTRO program that incorporates a Fermi resonance treatment utilizing intensity redistribution. We show that the 3 mu m region is dominated by the effects of anharmonicity, resulting in many more bands than would have been expected in a purely harmonic approximation. Importantly, we find that anharmonic spectra as calculated by SPECTRO are in good agreement with the experimental spectra. Together with previously reported high-resolution spectra of linear acenes, the present spectra provide us with an extensive data set of spectra of PAHs with a varying number of aromatic rings, with geometries that range from open to highly condensed structures, and featuring CH groups in all possible edge configurations. We discuss the astrophysical implications of the comparison of these spectra on the interpretation of the appearance of the aromatic infrared 3 mu m band, and on features such as the two-component emission character of this band and the 3 mu m emission plateau.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have long been invoked in the study of interstellar and protostellar sources, but the unambiguous identification of any individual PAH has proven elusive until very recently. As a result, the formation mechanisms for this important class of molecules remain poorly constrained. Here we report the first interstellar detection of a pure hydrocarbon PAH, indene (C9H8), as part of the GBT Observations of TMC-1: Hunting for Aromatic Molecules (GOTHAM) survey. This detection provides a new avenue for chemical inquiry, complementing the existing detections of CN-functionalized aromatic molecules. From fitting the GOTHAM observations, indene is found to be the most abundant organic ring detected in TMC-1 to date. And from astrochemical modeling with nautilus, the observed abundance is greater than the model's prediction by several orders of magnitude, suggesting that current formation pathways in astrochemical models are incomplete. The detection of indene in relatively high abundance implies related species such as cyanoindene, cyclopentadiene, toluene, and styrene may be detectable in dark clouds.

AB  - We present a new method to decompose the emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from mid-infrared spectra using theoretical PAH templates in conjunction with modified blackbody components for the dust continuum and an extinction term. The primary goal is to obtain robust measurements of the PAH features, which are sensitive to the star formation rate, in a variety of extragalactic environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique, starting with the simplest Galactic high-latitude clouds to extragalactic systems of ever-increasing complexity, from normal star-forming galaxies to low-luminosity active galaxies, quasars, and heavily obscured infrared-luminous galaxies. In addition to providing accurate measurements of the PAH emission, including the upper limits thereof, our fits can reproduce reasonably well the overall continuum shape and constrain the line-of-sight extinction. Our new PAH line flux measurements differ systematically and significantly from those of previous methods by similar to 15% to as much as a factor of similar to 6. The decomposed PAH spectra show remarkable similarity among different systems, suggesting a uniform set of conditions responsible for their excitation.

AB  - Using the Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope, we present low-resolution (64 < lambda/delta lambda < 124), mid-infrared (20-38 mu m) spectra of 23 high-redshift ULIRGs detected in the Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. All of the sources were selected to have (1) f(v)(24 mu m) > 0.5mJy; (2) R-[24] > 14 Vega mag; and (3) a prominent rest frame 1.6 mu m stellar photospheric feature redshifted into Spitzer's 3-8 mu m IRAC bands. Of these, 20 show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), usually interpreted as signatures of star formation. The PAH features indicate redshifts in the range 1.5 < z < 3.0, with a mean of < z > = 1.96 and a dispersion of 0.30. Based on local templates, these sources have extremely large infrared luminosities, comparable to that of submillimeter galaxies. Our results confirm previous indications that the rest-frame 1.6 mu m stellar bump can be efficiently used to select highly obscured star-forming galaxies at z approximate to 2, and that the fraction of starburst-dominated ULIRGs increases to faint 24 mu m flux densities. Using local templates, we find that the observed narrow redshift distribution is due to the fact that the 24 mu m detectability of PAH-rich sources peaks sharply at z = 1.9. We can analogously use observed spectral energy distributions to explain the broader redshift distribution of Spitzer-detected ULIRGs that are dominated by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Finally, we conclude that z approximate to 2 sources with a detectable 1.6 mu m stellar opacity feature lack sufficient AGN emission to veil the 7.7 mu m PAH band.

AB  - We report on an experimental and theoretical investigation of the importance of anharmonicity in the 3-mu m CH stretching region of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. We present mass-resolved, high-resolution spectra of the gas-phase cold (similar to 4 K) linear PAH molecules naphthalene, anthracene, and tetracene. The measured IR spectra show a surprisingly high number of strong vibrational bands. For naphthalene, the observed bands are well separated and limited by the rotational contour, revealing the band symmetries. Comparisons are made to the harmonic and anharmonic approaches of the widely used Gaussian software. We also present calculated spectra of these acenes using the computational program SPECTRO, providing anharmonic predictions with a Fermiresonance treatment that utilizes intensity redistribution. We demonstrate that the anharmonicity of the investigated acenes is strong, dominated by Fermi resonances between the fundamental and double combination modes, with triple combination bands as possible candidates to resolve remaining discrepancies. The anharmonic spectra as calculated with SPECTRO lead to predictions of the main bands that fall within 0.5% of the experimental frequencies. The implications for the aromatic infrared bands, specifically the 3-mu m band, are discussed.

AB  - The mid- and the far-infrared spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been computed using density functional theory. This study has focused on PAHs in the highly symmetric, compact, coronene family with sizes up to 384 carbons. We have identified trends in the peak position and intrinsic strength of the vibrational modes of these species and compared these to trends previously reported for less symmetric and smaller PAHs. The computed spectral modes have been used to calculate the IR emission spectrum of PAHs pumped by UV photons. The results have been compared to observed interstellar spectra to elucidate the characteristics of the interstellar PAH family. The calculations show that highly symmetric PAHs are very stable and, hence, might be favored under the harsh conditions of interstellar space. Our calculated vibrational properties confirm and extend previous studies for small PAHs to the large compact PAHs studied here, specifically in terms of the dependence of the spectral characteristics on ionization and on H-adjacency. The calculations show that for PAHs larger than 150 carbons, the 6.3 mu m feature becomes very broad and shifts to longer wavelengths, the 8.6 mu m band becomes stronger than the "7.7" mu m band, and the 11.0/12.7 band strength ratio gets too large compared with observations. Thus, PAHs with 150 carbons or more are unlikely to be the dominant species in interstellar space. The simplicity of the observed spectra in the 15-20 mu m range points toward a preponderance of compact PAHs in the interstellar PAH family.

AB  - Polarized emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) potentially provides a new way to test the. basic physics of the alignment of ultrasmall grains. In this paper, we present a new model of polarized PAH emission that takes into account the effect of PAH alignment with the magnetic field. We first generate a large sample of the grain angular momentum J by simulating the alignment of PAHs due to resonance paramagnetic relaxation that accounts for various interaction processes. We then calculate the polarization level of the. PAH emission features. for the different phases of the interstellar medium, including the cold neutral medium (CNM), reflection nebulae (RNe), and photodissociation regions. We find that a moderate degree. of. PAH alignment can significantly enhance the polarization degree of the. PAH emission compared to the previous results obtained with randomly oriented angular momentum. In particular, we find that the. smallest. negatively charged PAHs in RNe can be excited to slightly suprathermal rotation due to enhanced ion collisional excitation, resulting in an increase of the polarization with the ionization fraction. Our results suggest that an. RN is the most favorable environment in which. to observe polarized PAH emission and to test the. alignment physics of nanoparticles. Finally, we present an explicit relationship between the polarization level of PAH emission and the degree of external alignment for the CNM and RNe. The obtained relationship will be particularly useful for testing the. alignment physics of PAHs in. future observations.

AB  - In this paper, we present the results of a computational study of the effects of a low absolute level of deuteration (similar to5%) on the observed mid-IR spectrum of the interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) population. The analyses are based on a global average spectrum, including all the possible singly deuterated isomers of an ensemble of partially superhydrogenated PAH species (i.e., H-n-PAHs) in both neutral and cationic forms. The distinctive spectroscopic properties considered in this paper include three classes of D-involved vibrational modes: (1) C-D in-plane bending features in the 9.5-12 mum region, (2) C-D out-of-plane bending features in the 14.5-17.9 mum region, and (3) aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching features in the 4.4-4.7 mum region. In addition, D substitution also has the potential to alter the appearance of the C-H out-of-plane bending features in the 11-14 mum region by disrupting the adjacency of the H atoms on the PAH edge rings. The spectroscopic impacts of a low level of deuteration in the interstellar PAH population are considered, and their implications for the detailed appearance of the astronomical mid-IR PAH emission spectrum is explored. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the C-D stretching features offer the greatest prospects for the detection of deuterated interstellar PAHs. Since these features are effectively obscured by telluric CO2 absorptions, the information presented herein should be useful in the planning and design of future space-based IR observing platforms.

AB  - The role of aliphatic side groups in the formation of astronomical unidentified infrared emission (UIE) features is investigated by applying the density functional theory to a series of molecules with mixed aliphatic-aromatic structures. The effects of introducing various aliphatic groups to a fixed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) core (ovalene) are studied. Simulated spectra for each molecule are produced by applying a Drude profile at T = 500 K while the molecule is kept at its electronic ground state. The vibrational normal modes are classified using a semi-quantitative method. This allows us to separate the aromatic and aliphatic vibrations, and therefore provides clues to what types of vibrations are responsible for the emissions bands at different wavelengths. We find that many of the UIE bands are not pure aromatic vibrational bands but may represent coupled vibrational modes. The effects of aliphatic groups on the formation of the 8 mu m plateau are quantitatively determined. The vibrational motions of methyl (-CH3) and methylene (-CH2-) groups can cause the merging of the vibrational bands of the parent PAH and the forming of broad features. These results suggest that aliphatic structures can play an important role in the UIE phenomenon.

AB  - The distinctive set of infrared (IR) emission bands at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 mu m are ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysical environments. They are generally attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, not a single PAH species has yet been identified in space, as the mid-IR vibrational bands are mostly representative of functional groups and thus do not allow one to fingerprint individual PAH molecules. In contrast, the far-IR (FIR) bands are sensitive to the skeletal characteristics of a molecule, hence they are important for chemical identification of unknown species. With an aim to offer laboratory astrophysical data for the Herschel Space Observatory, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, and similar future space missions, in this work we report neutral and cation FIR spectroscopy of pentacene (C22H14), a five-ring PAH molecule. We report three IR active modes of cationic pentacene at 53.3, 84.8, and 266 mu m that may be detectable by space missions such as the SAFARI instrument on board SPICA. In the experiment, pentacene is vaporized from a laser desorption source and cooled by a supersonic argon beam. We have obtained results from two-color resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization and two-color zero kinetic energy photoelectron (ZEKE) spectroscopy. Several skeletal vibrational modes of the first electronically excited state of the neutral species and those of the cation are assigned, with the aid of ab initio and density functional calculations. Although ZEKE is governed by the Franck-Condon principle different from direct IR absorption or emission, vibronic coupling in the long ribbon-like molecule results in the observation of a few IR active modes. Within the experimental resolution of similar to 7 cm(-1), the frequency values from our calculation agree with the experiment for the cation, but differ for the electronically excited intermediate state. Consequently, modeling of the intensity distribution is difficult and may require explicit inclusion of vibronic interactions.

AB  - We report a strong correlation between the [C II] 158 mum cooling line and the mid-infrared flux in the 5-10 mum range in a wide variety of star-forming galaxies. The mid-infrared flux is dominated by the aromatic features in emission (AFEs), which are thought to arise from large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and are generally associated with the smallest interstellar grains. The [C II] line is the dominant gas coolant in most regions of atomic interstellar gas and therefore reflects the heating input to the gas. The ratio of these two quantities, [C II]/AFE, remains nearly constant around 1.5% against variations in the ratio of the IRAS 60 mum band flux to the 100 mum band flux, R(60/100). This is in contrast to the drop in the [C II]/far-infrared (FIR) ratio with increasing R(60/100), which signals higher dust temperatures and more intense radiation fields. We interpret the stable [C II]/AFE ratio as evidence that gas heating is dominated by the PAHs or small grains, which are also AFE carriers, over a wide range of conditions. The trend of decreasing [C II]/FIR and AFE/FIR with increasing radiation field suggests a decrease in the importance of PAHs or small grains relative to large grains both in gas heating and in dust cooling. We summarize the observed trends and suggest two plausible scenarios.

AB  - We present Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph 14-36 mu m mapping observations of the supernova remnant N132D in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This study focuses on the processing of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that we previously identified in the southern blast wave. The mid-infrared spectra show strong continuum emission from shock-heated dust and a unique, nearly featureless plateau in the 15-20 mu m region, which we attribute to PAH molecules. The typical PAH emission bands observed in the surrounding interstellar medium ahead of the blast wave disappear, which indicates shock processing of PAH molecules. The PAH plateau appears most strongly at the outer edge of the blast wave and coincides with diffuse X-ray emission that precedes the brightest X-ray and optical filaments. This suggests that PAH molecules in the surrounding medium are swept up and processed in the hot gas of the blast wave shock, where they survive the harsh conditions long enough to be detected. We also observe a broad emission feature at 20 mu m appearing with the PAH plateau. We speculate that this feature is either due to FeO dust grains or connected to the processing of PAHs in the supernova blast wave shock.

AB  - The loss of one hydrogen from C96H24 does not significantly affect the infrared spectra of the neutral, cation, or anion. Excluding a very weak C-C stretching band at 5.1 mu m, the loss of two adjacent duo hydrogens does not significantly affect the spectra compared with the parent. Removing all of the hydrogen atoms significantly increases the intensity of the new C-C stretching band, and, for the cation, shifts it to a longer (5.2 mu m) wavelength. Observations show a feature near 5.25 mu m, which has been attributed to overtone and combination bands from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This current work suggests that dehydrogenated PAHs might also contribute to this band, but its weakness implies that fully dehydrogenated cationic or dicationic species are very rare.

AB  - We have systematically investigated a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with armchair edges that maximize the aromaticity, denoted as Clar PAHs, using density functional theory. Their structures fall into three major categories: branched, intermediate, and armchair. Branched PAHs contain up to 60 carbons, they are eroded and the least stable, and their spectra are the most complex. Armchair PAHs are the most stable and their spectra differ from the nominal PAH spectra by lacking a 11.2 mu m band and having their 7.8 and 8.2 mu m bands coalesce as their size increases. Only intermediate and armchair PAHs have 12.7/13.5 m PAH band intensity ratios that are consistent with observations. The fitting results show that Clar PAH spectra are more consistent with class B than class A sources, with only a few small Clar PAHs contributing to the fit of the class A source IRAS 23133+6050 and large Clar PAHs contributing to the fit of the class B source IRAS 17347-3139, and NGC 7027. Overall, our study suggests that large Clar PAHs are potential emitters in class B sources.

AB  - Vacuum ultraviolet irradiation of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecule, pyrene, trapped in carbon dioxide (CO2)-enriched astrophysical ice analogues has been studied and presented here. Pyrene is co-deposited with a gaseous mixture of H2O and CO2 (100% CO2; 50:50 CO2:H2O; and 100% H2O) and is subjected to Lye, photons from a hydrogen-flow microwave discharge lamp. To our surprise, we found ionization of pyrene in all three ices, with ionization yields following the H2O content in the ice, indicating that H2O ice stabilizes charged ions and electrons better than CO2 ice by a factor of 10. Caution needs to be exercised not to overinterpret our finding that pyrene is ionized in pure CO2 ice, because even trace amounts of water in the CO2 matrix could result in an increased ionization of pyrene. In addition to ionization of pyrene in CO2 ice, photochemical products of the CO2 ice itself, namely CO and CO3, were found to form efficiently, as detected using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, in agreement with earlier studies. UV vis spectra showed formation of ozone (O-3) with prolonged irradiation. Surprisingly, O-3 yields followed CO2 concentration in the ice mixtures, with the strongest bands in photolyzed CO2 ice and the weakest in photolyzed H2O ice, indicating that CO2 ice is very protoreactive and produces more O atoms than H2O ice. Pyrene-containing photoproducts, incorporating CO2 or CO or O, such as Py-COOH, Py-OH, or Py-CHO, are not explicitly seen in the UV vis absorption spectra, but we cannot rule out the possibility that their UV absorption may be swamped under the strong absorption of O-3.

AB  - We report the results of a search for emission features from interstellar deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the 4 mu m region with the Infrared Camera (IRC) on board AKARI. No significant excess emission is seen in 4.3-4.7 mu m in the spectra toward the Orion Bar and M17 after the subtraction of line emission from the ionized gas. A small excess of emission remains at around 4.4 and 4.65 mu m, but the ratio of their intensity to that of the band emission from PAHs at 3.3-3.5 mu m is estimated as 2%-3%. This is an order of magnitude smaller than the values previously reported and also those predicted by the model of deuterium depletion onto PAHs. Since the subtraction of the ionized gas emission introduces an uncertainty, the deuterated PAH features are also searched for in the reflection nebula GN 18.14.0, which does not show emission lines from ionized gas. We obtain a similar result that excess emission in the 4 mu m region, if present, is about 2% of the PAH band emission in the 3 mu m region. The present study does not find evidence for the presence of the large amount of deuterated PAHs that the depletion model predicts. The results are discussed in the context of deuterium depletion in the interstellar medium.

AB  - The formation and destruction mechanisms of interstellar dust analogs formed from a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and hydrocarbon molecular precursors are studied in the laboratory. We used the newly developed facility COSmIC, which simulates interstellar and circumstellar environments, to investigate both PAHs and species that include the cosmically abundant atoms O, N, and S. The species generated in a discharge plasma are detected, monitored, and characterized in situ using highly sensitive techniques that provide both spectral and ion mass information. We report here the first series of measurements obtained in these experiments which focus on the characterization of the most efficient molecular precursors in the chemical pathways that eventually lead to the formation of carbonaceous grains in the stellar envelopes of carbon stars. We compare and discuss the relative efficiencies of the various molecular precursors that lead to the formation of the building blocks of carbon grains. We discuss the most probable molecular precursors in terms of size and structure and the implications for the expected growth and destruction processes of interstellar carbonaceous dust.

AB  - We have observed a small sample of hot post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The stars were selected from the literature on the basis of their far-infrared (IR) excess (i.e., post-AGB candidates) and B spectral type (i.e., close to the ionization of the envelope). The combination of our IRAC observations with Two Micron All Sky Survey and IRAS catalog data, along with previous radio observations in the cm range (where available) allowed us to model the spectral energy distributions of our targets and find that in almost all of them at least two shells of dust at different temperatures must be present, the hot dust component ranging up to 10(3) K. In several targets, grains larger than 1 mu m are needed to match the far-IR data points. In particular, in IRAS 17423-1755 grains up to 100 mu m must be introduced to match the emission in the millimeter range. We obtained IRS spectra to identify the chemistry of the envelopes and found that more than one-third of the sources in our sample have mixed chemistry, showing both mid-IR bands attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and silicate features. The analysis of the PAH features indicates that these molecules are located in the outflows, far away from the central stars. We consider the larger than expected percentage of mixed-chemistry targets as a selection bias toward stars with a disk or torus around them. Our results strengthen the current picture of mixed chemistry being due to the spatial segregation of different dust populations in the envelopes.

AB  - The observed depletion of iron in the interstellar medium has been suggested to result from its efficient complexation with, among others, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs). We present here the first experimental vibrational spectra of cationic iron-PAH complexes with benzene, naphthalene, and fluorene. The spectra were obtained by infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy of the complex ions trapped in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer. A continuously tunable free electron laser provided intense radiation in the astrophysically interesting wavelength range of 6-16 mu m. Supporting calculations of the geometries, relative stabilities, and harmonic vibrational frequencies of the complexes were carried out using density functional theory with the MPW1PW91/6-31+G(d,p) functional/basis set. In all cases, the experimental spectra indicate that Fe+ is bound to the six-membered carbon ring of the aromatic ligand in a high-spin (quartet) electronic ground state for the mono-complexes, Fe(benzene)(+) and Fe(naphthalene)+, and in a low-spin (doublet) electronic ground state for the bis-complexes,Fe(benzene)(+)2, Fe(naphthalene)(+)2, and Fe(Cuorene)(+)2 complexes. Comparison of the complex spectra to the bare (neutral and cationic) PAH spectra reveals their spectroscopic fingerprint, e. g., in the splitting of the out-of-plane CH-bending modes, which could aid in their interstellar detection.

AB  - We have modeled the states of hydrogenation and charge of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in diffuse clouds for molecules ranging from benzene up to species containing 200 carbon atoms. It is found that the hydrogenation state of PAHs strongly depends on the size of the molecule. Small PAHs with fewer than about 15-20 carbon atoms are destroyed in most environments. Intermediate-size PAHs in the range of 20-30 carbon atoms are stripped of most of their peripheral hydrogen atoms, but may be able to survive in the interstellar medium because of the relative stability of their carbon skeleton upon UV photon absorption. Larger PAHs primarily have normal hydrogen coverage (i.e., with each peripheral carbon atom bearing a single hydrogen), with competition between this form and PAHs containing an additional hydrogen. Very large PAHs may be fully hydrogenated, with every peripheral carbon atom bearing two hydrogen atoms. Our finding that extremely dehydrogenated PAH neutrals or positively charged C(m)H(n)((+)), with m ranging from 15 to 30 and n less than or equal to 2, can survive in the interstellar medium contrasts with previous work, where it was generally assumed that PAHs losing their hydrogen coverage were quickly destroyed. A mechanism is proposed for the selective growth of these small dehydrogenated PAHs in diffuse clouds with respect to larger PAHs. Finally, our results are compared to previous studies on the hydrogenation and charge states of PAHs.

AB  - We observed the oxygen-rich Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) supernova remnant N132D (SNR 0525-69.6), using all instruments on board the Spitzer Space Telescope, IRS, IRAC, and MIPS (Infrared Spectrograph, Infrared Array Camera, and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer). The 5-40 mu m IRS spectra toward the southeastern shell of the remnant show a steeply rising continuum with [Ne III] and [O IV], as well as PAH emission. We also present the spectrum of a fast moving ejecta knot, previously detected at optical wavelengths, which is dominated by strong [Ne III] and [O IV] emission lines. We interpret the continuum as thermal emission from swept-up, shock-heated dust grains in the expanding shell of N132D, which is clearly visible in the MIPS 24 pm image. A 15-20 mu m emission hump appears superposed on the dust continuum, and we attribute this to PAH C-C-C bending modes. We also detect the well-known 11.3 mu m PAH C-H bending feature, and find the integrated strength of the 15-20 pm hump about a factor of 7 stronger than the 11.3 mu m band in the shell of the remnant. IRAC 3-9 mu m images do not show clear evidence of large-scale, shell-like emission from the remnant, partly due to confusion with the ambient ISM material. However, we identified several knots of shocked interstellar gas based on their distinct infrared colors. We discuss the bright infrared continuum and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features with respect to dust processing in young supernova remnants.

AB  - Infrared (IR) emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 mum are generally attributed to IR fluorescence from ( mainly) far-ultraviolet (FUV) pumped large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. As such, these features trace the FUV stellar flux and are thus a measure of star formation. We examined the IR spectral characteristics of Galactic massive star-forming regions and of normal and starburst galaxies, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). The goal of this study is to analyze whether PAH features are a good qualitative and/or quantitative tracer of star formation, and hence to evaluate the application of PAH emission as a diagnostic tool in order to identify the dominant processes contributing to the infrared emission from Seyfert galaxies and ULIRGs. We develop a new mid-infrared (MIR)/far-infrared ( FIR) diagnostic diagram based on our Galactic sample and compare it to the diagnostic tools of Genzel and coworkers and Laurent and coworkers, with these diagnostic tools also applied to our Galactic sample. This MIR/FIR diagnostic is derived from the FIR normalized 6.2 mum PAH flux and the FIR normalized 6.2 mum continuum flux. Within this diagram, the Galactic sources form a sequence spanning a range of 3 orders of magnitude in these ratios, ranging from embedded compact H II regions to exposed photodissociation regions (PDRs) and the ( diffuse) interstellar medium ( ISM). However, the variation in the 6.2 mum PAH feature - to - continuum ratio is relative small. Comparison of our extragalactic sample with our Galactic sources revealed an excellent resemblance of normal and starburst galaxies to exposed PDRs. While Seyfert 2 galaxies coincide with the starburst trend, Seyfert 1 galaxies are displaced by at least a factor of 10 in 6.2 mum continuum flux, in accordance with general orientation-dependent unification schemes for AGNs. ULIRGs show a diverse spectral appearance. Some show a typical AGN hot dust continuum. More, however, either are starburst-like or show signs of strong dust obscuration in the nucleus. One characteristic of the ULIRGs also seems to be the presence of more prominent FIR emission than either starburst galaxies or AGNs. We discuss the observed variation in the Galactic sample in view of the evolutionary state and the PAH/dust abundance and discuss the use of PAHs as quantitative tracers of star formation activity. Based on these investigations, we find that PAHs may be better suited as a tracer of B stars, which dominate the Galactic stellar energy budget, than as a tracer of massive star formation (O stars).

AB  - Ratios of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) vibrational bands are a promising tool for measuring the properties of the PAH population and their effect on star formation. The photometric bands of the MIRI and NIRCam instruments on JWST provide the opportunity to measure PAH emission features across entire galaxy disks at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Here we present the first results of this analysis in a sample of three nearby galaxies: NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496. Based on the variations observed in the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 mu m features, we infer changes to the average PAH size and ionization state across the different galaxy environments. High values of F335M(PAH)/F1130W and low values of F1130W/F770W are measured in H ii regions in all three galaxies. This suggests that these regions are populated by hotter PAHs, and/or that the PAH ionization fraction is larger. We see additional evidence of heating and/or changes in PAH size in regions with higher molecular gas content as well as increased ionization in regions with higher H alpha intensity.

AB  - We report the detection of 6.2 mu m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and rest-frame 4-7 mu m continuum emission in the z = 4.055 submillimeter galaxy GN20, using the Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. This represents the first detection of PAH emission atz > 4. The strength of the PAH emission feature is consistent with a very high star formation rate of similar to 1600M(circle dot) yr(-1). We find that this intense starburst powers at least similar to 1/3 of the faint underlying 6 mu m continuum emission, with an additional, significant (and perhaps dominant) contribution due to a power-law-like hot dust source, which we interpret to likely be a faint, dust-obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN). The inferred 6 mu m AGN continuum luminosity is consistent with a sensitive upper limit on the hard X-ray emission as measured by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory if the previously undetected AGN is Compton-thick. This is in agreement with the finding at optical/infrared wavelengths that the galaxy and its nucleus are heavily dust-obscured. Despite the strong power-law component enhancing the mid-infrared continuum emission, the intense starburst associated with the photon-dominated regions that give rise to the PAH emission appears to dominate the total energy output in the infrared. GN20 is one of the most luminous starburst galaxies known at any redshift, embedded in a rich protocluster of star-forming galaxies. This investigation provides an improved understanding of the energy sources that power such exceptional systems, which represent the extreme end of massive galaxy formation at early cosmic times.

AB  - We investigate the emission properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in various metallicity environments with the Infrared Spectrograph on board Spitzer. Local giant H II regions are used as references as they enable access to the distinct interstellar medium components that contribute to the mid-infrared spectrum of star-forming galaxies: photodissociation regions (PDRs), photoionized gas, stellar clusters, and embedded regions. Three objects are considered: NGC 3603 in the Milky Way, 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and N 66 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. From the variations of the PAH/14 mu m ratio, we find that PAHs are destroyed in the ionized gas for a radiation field such that [ Ne III]/[ Ne II] greater than or similar to 3. From the variations of the PAH/Hu alpha ratio, we find that the PAH emission sources in the giant H II regions follow the same photodestruction law regardless of metallicity. We then compare these results with observations of starburst galaxies, Hii galaxies, and blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs). While the integrated mid-infrared spectra of BCDs are reminiscent of a warm dusty ionized gas, we observe a significant contribution to the PAH emission in starburst galaxies that is not arising from PDRs.

AB  - We performedmid-infrared spectroscopic observations of 18 local dusty elliptical galaxies by using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board Spitzer. We have significantly detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features from 14 out of the 18 galaxies and, thus, found that the presence of PAHs is not rare but rather common in dusty elliptical galaxies. Most of these galaxies show an unusually weak 7.7 mu m emission feature relative to 11.3 and 17 mu m emission features. A large fraction of the galaxies also exhibit H-2 rotational line and ionic fine-structure line emissions, which have no significant correlation with the PAH emissions. The PAH features are well correlated with the continuum at 35 mu m, whereas they are not correlated with the continuum at 6 mu m. We conclude that the PAH emission of the elliptical galaxies is mostly of interstellar origin rather than of stellar origin, and that the unusual PAH interband strength ratios are likely to be due to a large fraction of neutral to ionized PAHs.

AB  - Spitzer and AKARI observations have found that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are present in nearby elliptical galaxies, but their spatial distributions are still unknown. In order to investigate their distributions, we performed deep spectral mapping observations of the PAH-detected elliptical galaxy NGC 4589, a merger remnant with a minor-axis optical dust lane. As a result, we obtain clear evidence that the PAH 11.3 mu m emission comes predominantly from the dust lane of the galaxy. We also detect molecular hydrogen line emissions from the dust lane. The PAH 17 mu m emission is distributed differently from the PAH 11.3 mu m emission, and more similarly to the dust continuum emission. From their distinctive distributions, we suggest that the PAHs responsible for the 11.3 mu m feature are secondary products through the evolution of the interstellar medium brought in by the merger.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and dust emission features between 10 and 37 mu m, observed with Spitzer at 11 positions southeast of the Bright Bar (BB) in Orion, are analyzed and connected to atomic and H-2 lines reported earlier. Variations at these positions indicate changes in local conditions and materials sampled. The major findings are: (1) PAH erosion and destruction are important from the BB out to about 5'. (2) The ionized PAH fraction, inferred from the 11.0 mu m PAH band, increases from the BB out to 6.'5. This counterintuitive behavior is linked to PAH dehydrogenation. (3) The "11.2" mu m PAH band profile shifts from class Lambda(11.2) to Lambda(B)(11.2) between 9' and 10', indicating these lines-of-sight probe a different environment, likely shielded molecular cloud material. (4) The different spatial behavior of the PAH bands and the 10-15 mu m plateau supports the view that the plateau originates in a separate carrier. (5) The fullerene/PAH band strength ratio decreases out to about 7', increases between 9' and 10' and drops at 12'. The first region is where PAHs are dehydrogenated and eroded whereas the second, shielded zone, is where the "11.2" mu m profile shifts and PAH erosion is unlikely. This suggests fullerenes are intimately mixed with PAHs in shielded regions. Taken together, the observations suggest three different regimes are sampled: (1) the H II region-photodissociation region (PDR) interface directly southeast of the BB, (2) shielded molecular cloud material farther out, and (3) the H II region-PDR interface seen limb brightened at the outermost position.

AB  - Astronomical mid-IR spectra show two minor polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features at 5.25 and 5.7 mu m (1905 and 1754 cm(-1)) that hitherto have been little studied, but contain information about the astronomical PAH population that complements that of the major emission bands. Here, we report a study involving both laboratory and theoretical analysis of the fundamentals of PAH spectroscopy that produce features in this region and use these to analyze the astronomical spectra. The Infrared Space Observatory Short Wavelength Spectrograph spectra of 15 objects showing these PAH features were considered for this study, however only four (HD 44179; NGC7027; Orion Bar, two positions) have sufficient signal-to-noise between 5 and 6 mu m to allow for an in-depth analysis. All four astronomical spectra show similar peak positions and profiles. The 5.25 mu m feature is peaked and asymmetric, with an FWHM of about 0.12 +/- 0.01 mu m (similar to 40 +/- 6.5 cm(-1)), while the 5.7 mu m feature is broader and flatter, with an FWHM of about 0.17 +/- 0.02 mu m (50 +/- 5.6 cm(-1)). Detailed analysis of the laboratory spectra and quantum-chemical calculations show that the astronomical 5.25 and 5.7 mu m bands are a blend of combination, difference and overtone bands primarily involving CH stretching and CH in-plane and CH out-of-plane bending fundamental vibrations. The experimental and computational spectra show that, of all the hydrogen adjacency classes that are possible on PAHs, solo and duo hydrogens consistently produce prominent bands at the observed positions, whereas quartet hydrogens do not. In all, this study supports the picture that astronomical PAHs are large with compact, regular structures. From the coupling with primarily strong CH out-of-plane bending modes, one might surmise that the 5.25 and 5.7 mu m bands track the neutral PAH population. However, theory suggests that the role of charge in these astronomical bands might also be important.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) growth and destruction are thought to proceed via the occasional incorporation of five-and seven-membered fused ring defects in the hexagonal carbon skeleton. Using density functional theory, this paper investigates the effect such five-and seven-membered fused ring defects have on the infrared spectra of ovalene, circumovalene, and circumcircumovalene. The defects make only small changes to the overall infrared (IR) spectra, both in the mid-IR and in the far-IR, of these species. In addition to small shifts in the positions of the bands between the PAHs with and without defects, the most common effect of the defects is to increase the number of bands. Except for an anion with the Stone-Wales defect, all of the species studied have the C-C stretching band at 6.3 mu m or at longer wavelengths, the position in Classes B and C astronomical PAH spectra. In the case of the Stone-Wales anion, the band falls at 6.20 mu m, suggesting that further study of defects is probably worthwhile, as some PAHs with defects might be important in those sources (Class A) that show a C-C stretching band that falls near 6.2 mu m.

AB  - We present an updated phenomenological galaxy evolution model to fit the Spitzer 24, 70, and 160 mum number counts, as well as all the previous mid- and far-infrared observations. Only a minor change of the comoving luminosity density distribution in the previous model (Lagache, Dole, & Puget), combined with a slight modification of the starburst template spectra mainly between 12 and 30 mum, are required to fit all the data available. We show that the peak in the Spitzer Multiband Imaging Photometer 24 mum counts is dominated by galaxies with redshift between 1 and 2, with a nonnegligible contribution from the z greater than or equal to 2 galaxies ( similar to 30% at S = 0.2 mJy). The very close agreement between the model and number counts at 15 and 24 mum strikingly implies that ( 1) the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features remain prominent in the redshift band 0.5 - 2.5 and (2) the IR energy output has to be dominated by similar to3 x 10(11) L-. to similar to 3 x 10(12) L-. galaxies from redshift 0.5 to 2.5. Combining Spitzer with Infrared Space Observatory deep cosmological surveys gives for the first time an unbiased view of the infrared universe from z = 0 to 2.5.

AB  - Using physical models, we study the sensitivity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission spectra to the character of the illuminating starlight, to the PAH size distribution, and to the PAH charge distribution. The starlight models considered range from the emission from a 3 Myr old starburst, rich in far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, to the FUV-poor spectrum of the very old population of the M31 bulge. A wide range of starlight intensities is considered. The effects of reddening in dusty clouds are investigated for different starlight spectra. For a fixed PAH abundance parameter q (PAH) (the fraction of the total dust mass in PAHs with <10(3) C atoms), the fraction of the infrared power appearing in the PAH emission features can vary by a factor of two as the starlight spectrum varies from FUV-poor (M31 bulge) to FUV-rich (young starburst). We show how q (PAH) can be measured from the strength of the 7.7 mu m emission. The fractional power in the 17 mu m feature can be suppressed by high starlight intensities.

AB  - Using new large-area maps of the cold neutral medium (CNM) fraction, f (CNM), we investigate the relationship between the CNM, the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the anomalous microwave emission (AME). We first present our f (CNM) map based on full-sky HI4PI data, using a convolutional neural network to convert the spectroscopic H i data to f (CNM). We demonstrate that f (CNM) is strongly correlated with the fraction of dust in PAHs as estimated from mid- and far-infrared dust emission. In contrast, we find no correlation between f (CNM) and the amount of AME per dust emission and no to weakly negative correlation between f (CNM) and the AME peak frequency. These results suggest PAHs preferentially reside in cold, relatively dense gas, perhaps owing to enhanced destruction in more diffuse media. The lack of positive correlation between f (CNM) and AME peak frequency is in tension with expectations from theoretical models positing different spectral energy distributions of AME in the cold versus warm neutral medium. We suggest that different PAH abundances and emission physics in different interstellar environments may explain the weaker-than-expected correlation between 12 mu m PAH emission and AME even if PAHs are the AME carriers.

AB  - A systematic study was performed on the spectral properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with edge defects using harmonic density functional theory calculations. Their potential astronomical relevance was assessed through direct comparison with NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS spectra of the atomic photodissociation region of the Orion Bar from the JWST Early Release Science PDRs4All program. It is found that the astronomical 6.2 mu m PAH emission band, including its blue side, is well reproduced by PAHs with edge defects, when taking into account the effects of polarization in the computations, and without a need for PAHs that contain nitrogen. Small neutral PAHs with edge defects explain the blue wing of the 3.3 mu m band. A low number of edge defects is required to reproduce the 8.6 and 11.2 mu m band profiles, while the 11.0 + 11.2/12.7 mu m band intensity ratio is a measure for the number of edge defects. A blind database fit to the Orion Bar spectrum reproduces the 6-15 mu m region with an error of 9.9% and shows a clear delineation of charge, with the 6-10 mu m PAH bands being carried by PAH cations and the 10-15 mu m region by predominantly neutral PAHs. The contribution of anions is negligible. Armchair PAHs fit the 12.7 mu m band, simultaneously producing a very weak broad emission feature centered at 3.225 mu m. Zigzag PAHs fit the 11.2 mu m band. It is concluded that PAHs with a low number of edge defects, in addition to armchair and zigzag PAHs, all contribute to the observed interstellar infrared emission.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission has long been proposed to be a potential star formation rate indicator, as it arises from the photodissociation region bordering the Stromgren sphere of young, massive stars. We apply a recently developed technique of mid-infrared spectral decomposition to obtain a uniform set of PAH measurements from Spitzer.low-resolution spectra of a large sample of star-forming galaxies spanning a wide range in stellar mass (M-star approximate to 10(6) -10(11.4) M-circle dot) and star formation rate (similar to 0.1-2000 M-circle dot yr(-1)). High-resolution spectra are also analyzed to measure [Ne II] 12.8 mu m.and [Ne III] 15.6 mu m, which effectively trace the Lyman continuum. We present a new relation between PAH luminosity and star formation rate based on the [Ne II] and [Ne III] lines. Calibrations are given for the integrated 5-15 mu m.PAH emission, the individual features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 mu m, as well as several mid-infrared bandpasses sensitive to PAH. We confirm that PAH emission is suppressed in low-mass dwarf galaxies, and we discuss the possible physical origin of this effect.

AB  - Ices at 15 K consisting of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon coronene (C24H12) condensed either with H2O, CO2, or CO in the ratio of 1:100 or greater have been subjected to MeV proton bombardment from a Van de Graaff generator. The resulting reaction products have been examined by infrared transmission-reflection-transmission spectroscopy and by microprobe laser-desorption laser-ionization mass spectrometry. Just as in the case of UV photolysis, oxygen atoms are added to coronene, yielding, in the case of H2O ices, the addition of one or more alcohol (-OH) and ketone (>C=O) side chains to the coronene scaffolding. There are, however, significant differences between the products formed by proton irradiation and the products formed by UV photolysis of coronene containing CO and CO2 ices. The formation of a coronene carboxylic acid (-COOH) by proton irradiation is facile in solid CO but not in CO2, the reverse of what was previously observed for UV photolysis under otherwise identical conditions. This work presents evidence that cosmicray irradiation of interstellar or cometary ices should have contributed to the formation of aromatics bearing ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups in primitive meteorites and interplanetary dust particles.

TI  - Role of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons on the Cosmic-Ray Ionization Rate in the Galaxy
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The cosmic-ray (CR) ionization rate (zeta, s(-1)) plays an important role in the interstellar medium. It controls ion-molecular chemistry and provides a source of heating. Here we perform a grid of calculations using the spectral synthesis code CLOUDY along nine sightlines toward, HD 169454, HD 110432, HD 204827, lambda Cep, X Per, HD 73882, HD 154368, Cyg OB2 5, and Cyg OB2 12. The value of zeta is determined by matching the observed column densities of H-3(+) and H-2. The presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) affects the free electron density, which changes the H-3(+) density and the derived ionization rate. PAHs are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, but there are also regions where PAHs do not exist. Hence, we consider clouds within a range of PAH abundances and show their effects on the H-3(+) abundance. We predict an average CR ionization rate for H-2 (zeta(H-2)) = (7.88 2.89) x 10(-16) s(-1) for models with average Galactic PAH abundances, (PAH/H = 10(-6.52)), except Cyg OB2 5 and Cyg OB2 12. The value of zeta is nearly 1 dex smaller for sightlines toward Cyg OB2 12. We estimate the average value of zeta(H-2) = (95.69 46.56) x 10(-16) s(-1) for models without PAHs.

AB  - We present a sample of resolved galactic H. II regions and photodissociation regions (PDRs) observed with the Spitzer infrared spectrograph in spectral mapping mode between the wavelengths of 5-15 mu m. For each object we have spectral maps at a spatial resolution of similar to 4 '' in which we have measured all of the mid-infrared emission and absorption features. These include the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands, primarily at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2, and 12.7 mu m, as well as the spectral emission lines of neon and sulfur and the absorption band caused by silicate dust at around 9.8 mu m. In this work we describe the data in detail, including the data reduction and measurement strategies, and subsequently present the PAH emission band intensity correlations for each of the objects and the sample as a whole. We find that there are distinct differences between the sources in the sample, with two main groups: the first comprising the H. II regions and the second the reflection nebulae (RNe). Three sources-the reflection nebula NGC. 7023, the Horsehead nebula PDR (an interface between the H. II region IC 434 and the Orion B molecular cloud), and M17-resist this categorization, with the Horsehead PDR points mimicking the RNe and the NGC. 7023 fluxes displaying a unique bifurcated appearance in our correlation plots. These discrepancies seem to be due to the very low radiation field experienced by the Horsehead PDR and the very clean separation between the PDR environment and a diffuse environment in the NGC. 7023 observations.

AB  - We present spectra of the 3.3 mum and 11.2 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features of a large number of stellar sources, planetary nebulae, reflection nebulae, H II regions, and galaxies, obtained with Infrared Space Observatory Short Wavelength Spectrometer. Clear variations are present in the profiles of these features. Most of the sources show a symmetric 3.3 mum feature peaking at similar to3.290 mum, while only very few show an asymmetric 3.3 mum feature peaking at a slightly longer wavelength. The profiles of the 11.2 mum feature are distinctly asymmetric. The majority of the sources has a 11.2 mum feature peaking between 11.20 and 11.24 mum, with a very steep blue rise and a low tail-to-top ratio. A few sources show a 11.2 mum feature with a peak position of similar to11.25 mum, a less steep blue rise, and a high tail-to-top ratio. The sources are classified independently on the basis of the 3.3 and 11.2 mum feature profiles and peak positions. Correlations between these classes and those based on the 6-9 mum features (Peeters et al.) are found. In particular, sources with the most common profiles in the 6-9 mum region also show the most common 3.3 and 11.2 mum feature profiles. However, the uncommon profiles do not correlate with each other. Also, these classifications depend on the type of object. In general, H II regions, nonisolated Herbig AeBe stars and young stellar objects show the same profiles for all 3-12 mum features. Many planetary nebulae and post-asymptotic giant branch stars show uncommon feature profiles. The three galaxies in our sample show the same profiles as the H II regions for all but the 11.2 mum feature, being similar to that of evolved stars. The observed pronounced contrast in the spectral variations for the CH modes (3.3 and 11.2 mum bands) versus the CC modes (6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 mum bands) is striking: the peak wavelengths of the features attributed to CC modes vary by similar to15-80 cm(-1), while for the CH modes the variations are similar to4-6.5 cm(-1). We summarize existing laboratory data and theoretical calculations of the modes emitting in the 3-12 mum region of PAH molecules and complexes. In contrast to the 6.2 and 7.7 mum components, which are attributed to PAH cations, the 3.3 mum feature appears to originate in neutral and/or negatively charged PAHs. We attribute the variations in peak position and profile of these IR emission features to the composition of the PAH family. The variations in FWHM of the 3.3 mum feature remains an enigma, while those of the 11.2 mum can be explained by anharmonicity and molecular structure. The possible origin of the observed contrast in profile variations between the CH modes and the CC modes is highlighted.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features dominate the mid-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies and can be useful to calibrate star formation rates (SFRs) and diagnose ionized states of grains. However, the PAH 3.3 mu m feature has not been studied as much as other PAH features since it is weaker than others and resides outside of Spitzer capability. In order to detect and calibrate the 3.3 mu m PAH emission and investigate its potential as an SFR indicator, we carried out an AKARI mission program, AKARI mJy Unbiased Survey of Extragalactic Sources (AMUSES), and compared its sample with various literature samples. We obtained 2-5 mu m low-resolution spectra of 20 flux-limited galaxies with mixed spectral energy distribution classes, which yielded the detection of the 3.3 mu m PAH emission from 3 out of 20 galaxies. For the combined sample of AMUSES and literature samples, the 3.3 mu m PAH luminosities correlate with the infrared luminosities of star-forming galaxies, albeit with a large scatter (1.5 dex). The correlation appears to break down at the domain of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), and the power of the 3.3 mu m PAH luminosity as a proxy for the infrared luminosity is hampered at log[L-PAH3.3 erg(-1) s(-1)] > similar to 42.0. Possible origins for this deviation in the correlation are discussed, including contributions from active galactic nuclei and strongly obscured young stellar objects, and the destruction of PAH molecules in ULIRGs.

AB  - Deuterium (D) was exclusively generated in the Big Bang, and the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) model predicts a primordial abundance of D/H approximate to 26 parts per million (ppm). As the Galaxy evolves, D/H gradually decreases because of astration. The Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model predicts a present-day abundance of D/H greater than or similar to 20 ppm. However, observations of the local interstellar medium have revealed that the gas-phase interstellar D/H varies considerably from one region to another and has a median abundance of D/H approximate to 13 ppm, substantially lower than predicted from the BBN and GCE models. It has been suggested that the missing D atoms of D/H approximate to 7 ppm could have been locked up in deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, we have previously demonstrated that PAHs with aromatic C-D units are insufficient to account for the missing D. Here we explore if PAHs with aliphatic C-D units could be a reservoir of D. We perform quantum chemical computations of the vibrational spectra of superdeuterated PAHs (in which one D and one H share one C atom) and PAHs to which a D-substituted methyl group is attached, and derive the band strengths of the aliphatic C-D stretch (A(4).(65)). By applying the computationally derived A4.65 to the observed aliphatic C-D emission at similar to 4.6-4.8 mu m, we find that PAHs with aliphatic C-D units could have tied up a substantial amount of D/H and marginally account for the missing D. The possible routes for generating PAHs with aliphatic C-D units are also discussed.

AB  - IRAS 16279-4757 belongs to a group of post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars showing both polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bands and crystalline silicates. We present mid-infrared images that resolve the object for the first time. The morphology is similar to that of the "Red Rectangle" (HD 44179), the prototype object with PAHs and crystalline silicates. A two-component model and images suggest a dense oxygen-rich torus, an inner, low-density, carbon-rich region, and a carbon-rich bipolar outflow. The PAH bands are enhanced at the outflow, while the continuum emission is concentrated toward the center. Our findings support the suggestion that mixed chemistry and morphology are closely related. We discuss the Infrared Space Observatory Short-Wavelength Spectrometer (ISO SWS) spectra of IRAS 16279-4757. Several bands in the ISO SWS spectrum show a match with anorthite: this would be the first detection of this mineral outside the solar system. Compared to HD 44179, the shapes of PAH bands are closer to those of planetary nebulae, possibly related to a population of small PAHs present in HD 44179 but absent around IRAS 16279-4757. Detailed examination of the spectra shows the individual character of these two objects. The comparison suggests that the torus found in IRAS 16279-4757 may have formed more recently than that in HD 44179.

AB  - We introduce a novel model to spectroscopically constrain the mid-infrared (MIR) extinction/attenuation curve from 3-17 mu m, using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission drawn from an AKARI-Spitzer extragalactic cross-archival data set. Currently proposed MIR extinction curves vary significantly in their slopes toward the near-infrared, and the variation in the strengths and shapes of the 9.7 mu m and 18 mu m silicate absorption features make MIR spectral modeling and interpretation challenging, particularly for heavily obscured galaxies. By adopting the basic premise that PAH bands have relatively consistent intrinsic ratios within dusty starbursting galaxies, we can, for the first time, empirically determine the overall shape of the MIR attenuation curve by measuring the differential attenuation at specific PAH wavelengths. Our attenuation model shows PAH emission in most (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies is unambiguously subjected to attenuation, and we find strong evidence that PAH bands undergo differential attenuation as obscuration increases. Compared to preexisting results, the MIR attenuation curve derived from the model favors relatively gray continuum absorption from 3-8 mu m and silicate features with intermediate strength at 9.7 mu m but with stronger than typical 18 mu m opacity.

AB  - Context. The 3.3 mu m aromatic C-H stretching band of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules seen in a wide variety of astrophysical regions is often accompanied by a series of weak satellite bands at similar to 3.4-3.6 mu m. One of these sources, IRAS 21282 +5050, a planetary nebula, also exhibits a weak band at similar to 1.68 mu m. While the satellite features at similar to 3.4-3.6 mu m are often attributed to the anharmonicities of PAHs, it is not clear whether overtones or combination bands dominate the 1.68 mu m feature. Aims. In this work, we examine the anharmonic spectra of eight PAH molecules, including anthracene, tetracene, pentacene, phenanthrene, chrysene, benz[a]anthracene, pyrene, and perylene, to explore the origin of the infrared bands in the 1.6-1.7 mu m wavelength region. Methods. Density functional theory (DFT) in combination with the vibrational second-order perturbation theory (VPT2) was used to compute the anharmonic spectra of PAHs. To simulate the vibrational excitation process of PAHs, the Wang-Landau random walk technique was employed. Results. All the dominant bands in the 1.6-1.7 mu m wavelength range and in the 3.1-3.5 mu m C-H stretching region are calculated and tabulated. It is demonstrated that combination bands dominate the 1.6-1.7 mu m region, while overtones are rare and weak in this region. We also calculate the intensity ratios of the 3.1-3.5 mu m C-H stretching features to the bands in the 1.6-1.7 mu m region, I3.1-3:5/I1.6-1.7, for both ground and vibrationally excited states. On average, we obtain < I3.1-3.5=/I1.6-1.7 > approximate to 12.6 and < I3.1-3.5=/I1.6-1.7 > approximate to 17:6 for PAHs at ground states and at vibrationally excited states, respectively.

AB  - We report new properties of the 11 and 12.7 mu m. emission complexes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by applying a Gaussian- based decomposition technique. Using high- resolution Spitzer Space Telescope data, we study in detail the spectral and spatial characteristics of the 11 and 12.7 mu m. emission bands in maps of reflection nebulae NGC 7023 and NGC 2023 (north and south) and the star-forming region M17. Profile variations are observed in both the 11 and 12.7 mu m. emission bands. We identify a neutral contribution to the traditional 11.0 mu m. PAH band and a cationic contribution to the traditional 11.2 mu m. band, the latter of which affects the PAH class of the 11.2 mu m. emission in our sample. The peak variations of the 12.7 mu m. complex are explained by the competition between two underlying blended components. The spatial distributions of these components link them to cations and neutrals. We conclude that the 12.7 mu m. emission originates in both neutral and cationic PAHs, lending support to the use of the 12.7/11.2 intensity ratio as a charge proxy.

AB  - We report spatially resolved (FWHM similar to 3.'' 8-4.'' 6) mid-IR imaging observations of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7027 taken with the 2.5 m telescope on board the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). Images of NGC 7027 were acquired at 6.3, 6.6, 11.1, 19.7, 24.2, 33.6, and 37.1 mu m using the Faint Object Infrared Camera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST). The observations reveal emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and warm dust (T-D similar to 90 K) from the illuminated inner edge of the molecular envelope surrounding the ionized gas and central star. The DustEM code was used to fit the spectral energy distribution of fluxes obtained by FORCAST and the archival infrared spectrum of NGC 7027 acquired by the Short Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) on the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). Best-fit dust models provide a total dust mass of 5.8(-2.6)(+2.3) x 10(-3) M-circle dot, where carbonaceous large (a = 1.5 mu m) and very small (a similar to 12 angstrom) grains, and PAHs (3.1 angstrom < a < 12 angstrom) compose 96.5, 2.2, and 1.3% of the dust by mass, respectively. The 37 mu m optical depth map shows minima in the dust column density at regions in the envelope that are coincident with a previously identified collimated outflow from the central star. The optical depth minima are also spatially coincident with enhancements in the 6.2 mu m PAH feature, which is derived from the 6.3 and 6.6 mu m maps. We interpret the spatial anti-correlation of the dust optical depth and PAH 6.2 mu m feature strength and their alignment with the outflow from the central star as evidence of dust processing and rapid PAH formation via grain-grain collisions in the post-shock environment of the dense (n(H) similar to 10(5) cm(-3)) photo-dissociation region and molecular envelope.

AB  - We present measurements of 5-25 mu m emission features of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with strong optical emission lines in a sample of nine cool-core clusters of galaxies observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. These systems provide a view of dusty molecular gas and star formation, surrounded by dense, X-ray-emitting intracluster gas. Past work has shown that BCGs in cool-core clusters may host powerful radio sources, luminous optical emission-line systems, and excess UV, while BCGs in other clusters never show this activity. In this sample, we detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), extremely luminous, rotationally excited molecular hydrogen line emission, forbidden line emission from ionized gas ([Ne II] and [Ne III]), and infrared continuum emission from warm dust and cool stars. We show here that these BCGs exhibit more luminous forbidden neon and H-2 rotational line emission than star-forming galaxies with similar total infrared luminosities, as well as somewhat higher ratios of 70 mu m/24 mu m luminosities. Our analysis suggests that while star formation processes dominate the heating of the dust and PAHs, a heating process consistent with suprathermal electron heating from the hot gas, distinct from star formation, is heating the molecular gas and contributing to the heating of the ionized gas in the galaxies. The survival of PAHs and dust suggests that dusty gas is somehow shielded from significant interaction with the X-ray gas.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectral map of the northwest photon dominated region (PDR) in NGC 7023 was analyzed exclusively using PAH spectra from the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database (www.astrochem.org/pahdb). The 5-15 mu m spectrum at each pixel is fitted using a non-negative-least-squares fitting approach. The fits are of good quality, allowing decomposition of the PAH emission into four subclasses: size, charge, composition, and hydrogen adjacency (structure). Maps tracing PAH subclass distributions across the region paint a coherent astrophysical picture. Once past some 20 seconds of arc from HD 200775, the emission is dominated by the more stable, large, symmetric, compact PAH cations with smaller, neutral PAHs taking over along the lines-of-sight toward the more distant molecular cloud. The boundary between the PDR and the denser cloud material shows up as a distinct discontinuity in the breakdown maps. Noteworthy is the requirement for PANH cations to fit the bulk of the 6.2 and 11.0 mu m features and the indication of PAH photo-dehydrogenation and fragmentation close to HD 200775. Decomposition of the spectral maps into "principal" subclass template spectra provides additional insight into the behavior of each subclass. However, the general applicability of this computationally more efficient approach is presently undetermined. This is the first time the spectra of individual PAHs are exclusively used to fit the 5-15 mu m region and analyze the spatial behavior of the aromatic infrared bands, providing fundamental, new information about astronomical PAH subpopulations including their dependence on, and response to, changes in local conditions.

AB  - Emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a promising tool for estimating star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies, but the origin of its sources of excitation, which include not only young but possibly also old stars, remains uncertain. We analyze Spitzer mid-infrared mapping-mode spectroscopic observations of the nuclear and extranuclear regions of 33 nearby galaxies to study the contribution of evolved stars to PAH emission. In combination with photometric measurements derived from ultraviolet, H alpha, and infrared images, the spatially resolved spectral decomposition enables us to characterize the PAH emission, SFR, and stellar mass of the sample galaxies on subkiloparsec scales. We demonstrate that the traditional empirical correlation between PAH luminosity and SFR has a secondary dependence on specific SFR, or, equivalently, stellar mass. Ultraviolet-faint regions with lower specific SFRs and hence a greater fraction of evolved stars emit stronger PAH emission at fixed SFR than ultraviolet-bright regions. We reformulate the PAH-based SFR estimator by explicitly introducing stellar mass as a second parameter to account for the contribution of evolved stars to PAH excitation. The influence of evolved stars can explain the sublinear correlation between PAH emission and SFR, and it can partly account for the PAH deficit in dwarf galaxies and low-metallicity environments.

AB  - We study the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bands, ionic emission lines, and mid-infrared continuum properties in a sample of 171 emission line galaxies taken from the literature plus 15 new active galactic nucleus (AGN) Spitzer spectra. We normalize the spectra at lambda = 23 mu m and grouped them according to the type of nuclear activity. The continuum shape steeply rises for longer wavelengths and can be fitted with a warm blackbody distribution of T similar to 150-300 K. The brightest PAH spectral bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 mu m) and the forbidden emission lines of [Si II] 34.8 mu m, [Ar II] 6.9 mu m, [S III] 18.7 and 33.4 mu m were detected in all the starbursts and in similar to 80% of the Seyfert 2. Taking under consideration only the PAH bands at 7.7 mu m, 11.3 mu m, and 12.7 mu m, we find that they are present in similar to 80% of the Seyfert 1, while only half of this type of activity show the 6.2 mu m and 8.6 mu m PAH bands. The observed intensity ratios for neutral and ionized PAHs (6.2 mu m/7.7 mu m x 11.3 mu m/7.7 mu m) were compared to theoretical intensity ratios, showing that AGNs have higher ionization fraction and larger PAH molecules (>= 180 carbon atoms) than SB galaxies. The ratio between the ionized (7.7 mu m) and the neutral PAH bands (8.6 mu m and 11.3 mu m) are distributed over different ranges for AGNs and SB galaxies, suggesting that these ratios could depend on the ionization fraction, as well as on the hardness of the radiation field. The ratio between the 7.7 mu m and 11.3 mu m bands is nearly constant with the increase of [Ne III] 15.5 mu m/[Ne II] 12.8 mu m, indicating that the fraction of ionized to neutral PAH bands does not depend on the hardness of the radiation field. The equivalent width of both PAH features show the same dependence (strongly decreasing) with [Ne III]/[Ne II], suggesting that the PAH molecules, emitting either ionized (7.7 mu m) or neutral (11.3 mu m) bands, may be destroyed with the increase of the hardness of the radiation field.

AB  - We present the analysis of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) spectra of a sample of 92 typical star-forming galaxies at 0.03 < z < 0.2 observed with the Spitzer intensified Reticon spectrograph (IRS). We compare the relative strengths of PAH emission features with Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical diagnostics to probe the relationship between PAH grain properties and star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) activity. Short-to-long wavelength PAH ratios, and in particular the 7.7 mu m-to-11.3 mu m feature ratio, are strongly correlated with the star formation diagnostics D-n(4000) and H alpha equivalent width, increasing with younger stellar populations. This ratio also shows a significant difference between active and non-active galaxies, with the active galaxies exhibiting weaker 7.7 mu m emission. A hard radiation field as measured by [O III]/H beta and [Ne III](15.6 mu m)/[Ne II](12.8 mu m) effects PAH ratios differently depending on whether this field results from starburst activity or an AGN. Our results are consistent with a picture in which larger PAH molecules grow more efficiently in richer media and in which smaller PAH molecules are preferentially destroyed by the AGN.

AB  - Infrared spectroscopic studies of ultraviolet (UV) irradiated, water-rich, cosmic ice analogs containing small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are described. The irradiation studies of anthracene: H2O, pyrene: H2O, and benzo[ghi]perylene: H2O ices (14 K) at various concentrations reported by Bouwman et al. are extended. While aromatic alcohols and ketones have been reported in residues after irradiated PAH:H2O ices were warmed to 270 K, it was not known if they formed during ice irradiation or during warm-up when reactants interact as H2O sublimes. Recent work has shown that they form in low temperature ice. Using DFT computed IR spectra to identify photoproducts and PAH cations, we tentatively identify the production of specific alcohols [PAH(OH)(n)] and quinones [PAH(O)(n)] for all PAH:H2O ices considered here. Little evidence is found for hydrogenation at 14 K, consistent with the findings of Gudipati & Yang. Addition of O and OH to the parent PAH is the dominant photochemical reaction, but PAH erosion to smaller PAHs (producing CO2 and H2CO) is also important. DFT spectra are used to assess the contribution of PAH-related species to interstellar absorption features from 5 to 9 mu m. The case is made that PAH cations are important contributors to the C2 component and PAH(OH)(n) and PAH(O)(n) to the C5 component described by Boogert et al. Thus, interstellar ices should contain neutral and ionized PAHs, alcohols, ketones and quinones at the similar to 2%-4% level relative to H2O. PAHs, their photoproducts, and ion-mediated processes should therefore be considered when modeling interstellar ice processes.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are likely responsible for the family of infrared emission features seen in a wide variety of astrophysical environments. A potentially important subclass of these materials are PAHs whose edges contain excess H atoms (Hn-PAHs). This type of compound may be present in space, but it has been difficult to assess this possibility because of a lack of suitable laboratory spectra to assist with analysis of astronomical data. We present 4000-500 cm(-1) (2.5-20 mu m) infrared spectra of 23 Hn-PAHs and related molecules isolated in argon matrices under conditions suitable for interpretation of astronomical data. Spectra of molecules with mixed aromatic and aliphatic domains show characteristics that distinguish them from fully aromatic PAH equivalents. Two major changes occur as PAHs become more hydrogenated: (1) aromatic C-H stretching bands near 3.3 mu m weaken and are replaced with stronger aliphatic bands near 3.4 mu m, and (2) aromatic C-H out-of-plane bending mode bands in the 11-15 mu m region shift and weaken concurrent with growth of a strong aliphatic -CH2-deformation mode near 6.9 mu m. Implications for interpreting astronomical spectra are discussed with emphasis on the 3.4 and 6.9 mu m features. Laboratory data is compared with emission spectra from IRAS 21282+5050, an object with normal PAH emission features, and IRAS 22272+5435 and IRAS 0496+3429, two protoplanetary nebulae with abnormally large 3.4 mu m features. We show that "normal" PAH emission objects contain relatively few Hn-PAHs in their emitter populations, but less evolved protoplanetary nebulae may contain significant abundances of these molecules.

AB  - We present maps of the dust properties in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC, LMC) from fitting Spitzer and Herschel observations with the Draine & Li dust model. We derive the abundance of the small carbonaceous grain (or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; PAH) component. The global PAH fraction (q(PAH), the fraction of the dust mass in the form of PAHs) is smaller in the SMC (1.0(-0.3)(+0.3)%) than in the LMC (3.3(-1.3)(+1.4)%). We measure the PAH fraction in different gas phases (H II regions, ionized gas outside of H II regions, molecular gas, and diffuse neutral gas). H II regions appear as distinctive holes in the spatial distribution of the PAH fraction. In both galaxies, the PAH fraction in the diffuse neutral medium is higher than in the ionized gas, but similar to the molecular gas. Even at equal radiation field intensity, the PAH fraction is lower in the ionized gas than in the diffuse neutral gas. We investigate the PAH life-cycle as a function of metallicity between the two galaxies. The PAH fraction in the diffuse neutral medium of the LMC is similar to that of the Milky Way (similar to 4.6%), while it is significantly lower in the SMC. Plausible explanations for the higher PAH fraction in the diffuse neutral medium of the LMC compared to the SMC include: more effective PAH production by fragmentation of large grains at higher metallicity, and/or the growth of PAHs in molecular gas.

AB  - Low-resolution, mid-infrared Spitzer/IRS spectral maps are presented for three nearby, low-metallicity dwarf galaxies (NGC 55, NGC 3109, and IC 5152) for the purpose of examining the spatial distribution and variation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. The sample straddles a metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) approximate to 8, a transition point below which PAH intensity empirically drops and the character of the interstellar medium changes. We derive quantitative radiances of PAH features and atomic lines on both global and spatially resolved scales. The Spitzer spectra, combined with extensive ancillary data from the UV through the mid-infrared, allow us to examine changes in the physical environments and in PAH feature radiances down to a physical scale of similar to 50 pc. We discuss correlations between various PAH emission feature and atomic line radiances. The (6.2 mu m)/(11.3 mu m), (7.7 mu m)/(11.3 mu m), (8.6 mu m)/(11.3 mu m), (7.7 mu m)/(6.2 mu m), and (8.6 mu m)/(6.2 mu m) PAH radiance ratios are found to be independent of position across all three galaxies, although the ratios do vary from galaxy to galaxy. As seen in other galaxies, we find no variation in the grain size distribution as a function of local radiation field strength. Absolute PAH feature intensities as measured by a ratio of PAH/(24 mu m) radiances are seen to vary both positionally within a given galaxy and from one galaxy to another when integrated over the full observed extent of each system. We examine direct comparisons of CC mode PAH ratios (7.7 mu m)/(6.2 mu m) and (8.6 mu m)/(6.2 mu m) to the mixed (CC/CH) mode PAH ratio (7.7 mu m)/(11.3 mu m). We find little variation in either mode and no difference in trends between modes. While the local conditions change markedly over the observed regions of these galaxies, the properties of PAH emission show a remarkable degree of uniformity.

AB  - The Spitzer Space Telescope First Look Survey Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) near- and mid-infrared imaging data partially overlap the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with 313 visible-selected ( r < 17.6 mag) SDSS main sample galaxies in the overlap region. The 3.5 and 7.8 mu m properties of the galaxies are investigated in the context of their visible properties, where the IRAC [ 3.5] magnitude primarily measures starlight and the [ 7.8] magnitude primarily measures polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH) emission from the interstellar medium. As expected, we find a strong inverse correlation between [3.5]-[7.8] and visible color; galaxies red in visible colors ("red galaxies'') tend to show very little dust and molecular emission ( low PAH-to-star ratios), and galaxies blue in visible colors ("blue galaxies,'' i.e., star-forming galaxies) tend to show large PAH-to-star ratios. Red galaxies with high PAH- to-star ratios tend to be edge-on disks reddened by dust lanes. Simple attenuation corrections inferred in the visible bring the visible colors of these galaxies in line with those of face-on disks; i.e., PAH emission is closely related to attenuation-corrected star formation rates inferred in the visible. Blue galaxies with anomalously low PAH- to-star ratios are all low-luminosity star-forming galaxies. There is some weak evidence in this sample that the deficiency in PAH emission for these low-luminosity galaxies may be related to emission-line metallicity.

AB  - The gas-phase infrared spectra of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) cations have been recorded in the 10-50 mu m (or 1000-200 cm(-1)) spectral range via IR multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. Ionized PAHs are formed by UV laser ionization in an effusive beam and subsequently irradiated with a single pulse of narrowband tunable infrared light produced by the Free-Electron Laser for IntraCavity Experiments FELICE. The ion population is then analyzed in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Upon resonance, dissociation is induced so that IR spectra can be recorded by monitoring either the depleted parent ion intensity or the appearance of fragment ions as a function of the wavelength. The intracavity IR fluence enables the recording of IRMPD spectra of strongly bound PAH cations in the hitherto inaccessible far-IR spectral range. Experimental spectra are presented for the radical cations of anthracene, tetracene, pentacene, and coronene. Spectra calculated with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-311g(2df,2pd) level reproduce IR frequencies reasonably accurately in this spectral range when a uniform scaling factor of 0.94 over the complete 10-50 mu m spectral range is employed. We show that even vibrational modes with a calculated IR intensity lower than 1 km mol(-1) can be observed. For the catacondensed PAH cations we find CH out-of-plane bending vibrations involving four adjacent CH groups within a few wavenumbers of 733 cm(-1), closely matching the 13.6 mu m UIR band. For the larger systems, pentacene and coronene, we observe a continuous structureless background absorption above 400 cm(-1) which is attributed to the high density of IR dipole allowed combination modes for these systems.

AB  - Using the AKARI, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, we investigated the relation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) mass (M-PAH), very small grain mass (M-VSG), big grain mass (M-BG) and stellar mass (M-star) with galaxy merger for 55 star-forming galaxies at redshift z < 0.2. Using the SDSS image at z < 0.1 and the HST image at z > 0.1, we divided the galaxies into merger galaxies and non-merger galaxies with the morphological parameter asymmetry A, and quantified merging stages of galaxies based on the morphological indicators, the second-order momentum of the brightest 20 per cent region M-20 and the Gini coefficient. We find that M-PAH/M-BG of merger galaxies tend to be lower than that of non-merger galaxies and there are no systematic differences of M-VSG/M-BG and M-BG/M-star between merger galaxies and non-merger galaxies. We find that galaxies with very low M-PAH/M-BG seem to be merger galaxies at late stages. These results suggest that PAHs are partly destroyed at late stages of merging processes. Furthermore, we investigated MPAH/MBG variations in radiation field intensity strength G(0) and the emission line ratio of [O I] lambda 6300/H alpha that is a shock tracer for merger galaxies and find that M-PAH/M-BG decreases with increasing both G(0) and [O I]/H alpha. PAH destruction is likely to be caused by two processes: strong radiation fields and large-scale shocks during merging processes of galaxies.

AB  - Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and molecular hydrogen emission are a potentially powerful tool to derive physical properties of dense environments irradiated by intense UV fields. We present new, spatially resolved, Spitzer mid-IR spectroscopy of the high UV field and dense photodissociation region (PDR) around Monoceros R2, the closest ultracompact H II region, revealing the spatial structure of ionized gas, PAHs, and H-2 emissions. Using a PDR model and PAH emission feature fitting algorithm, we build a comprehensive picture of the physical conditions prevailing in the region. We show that the combination of the measurement of PAH ionization fraction and of the ratio between the H-2 0-0 S(3) and S(2) line intensities, respectively, at 9.7 and 12.3 mu m, allows us to derive the fundamental parameters driving the PDR: temperature, density, and UV radiation field when they fall in the ranges T = 250-1500 K, n(H) = 10(4)-10(6) cm(-3), and G(0) = 10(3)-10(5), respectively. These mid-IR spectral tracers thus provide a tool to probe the similar but unresolved UV-illuminated surface of protoplanetary disks or the nuclei of starburst galaxies.

AB  - One of the major challenges to identification of the 3.3, 6.2, 7. 7, 8.6, and 11.3 mum interstellar infrared (IR) emission bands with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules has been the recent detection of these bands in regions with little ultraviolet (UV) illumination, since small, neutral PAH molecules have little or no absorption at visible wavelengths and therefore require UV photons for excitation. We show here that our astronomical PAH model, incorporating the experimental result that the visual absorption edge shifts to longer wavelength upon ionization and/or as the PAH size increases, can closely reproduce the observed IR emission bands of vdB 133, a UV-poor reflection nebula. We also show that single-photon heating of "astronomical" PAHs in reflection nebulae near stars as cool as T-eff = 3000 K can result in observable emission at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 mum. Illustrative mid-IR emission spectra are calculated for reflection nebulae illuminated by cool stars with T-eff = 3500, 4500, and 5000 K. These will allow comparison with future Space Infrared Telescope Facility observations of vdB 135 (T-eff = 3600 K), vdB 47 (T-eff = 4500 K), and vdB 101 (T-eff = 5000 K). The dependence on the effective temperature of the exciting star of the observed 12 l m IRAS emission ( relative to the total far-IR emission) is consistent with the PAH model for 3000 K less than or equal to T-eff less than or equal to 30, 000 K.

AB  - Using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy we have obtained high-resolution spectra of individual molecular components containing 10(2)-10(3) carbon atoms at the surface of carbon nanoparticles. A number of well-defined spectral features occur in the 6.2, 7.6, 7.8, and 8.6 mu m wavelength range that replicate those found in the infrared emission spectrum of interstellar and circumstellar sources. This suggests that the molecular components present in laboratory samples are of similar composition to those occurring in space and provides additional insight into the chemical species responsible for infrared emission at these wavelengths. In particular, we find that laboratory spectra are produced by a relatively small number of molecular groups containing C=C bonds. These include large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polyacetylenic chains. Spectral features characteristic of type A, AB, B, and C infrared emission sources appear in different samples, indicating that the observed wavelength variations in astronomical sources can be attributed to changes in molecular size and composition. We also find that the infrared emission feature detected at approximate to 8.6 mu m in type A and B sources may arise from polyacetylenic species. Spectral profiles of laboratory bands are in good agreement with those of observed astronomical features. The broad background underlying the astronomical bands over the 6-9 mu m (1660-1100 cm(-1)) range is also reproduced in laboratory spectra.

AB  - We calibrate the integrated luminosity from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features at 6.2, 7.7, and 11.3 mu m in galaxies as a measure of the star formation rate (SFR). These features are strong (containing as much as 5%-10% of the total infrared luminosity) and suffer minimal extinction. Our calibration uses Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) measurements of 10(5) galaxies at 0 < z < 0.4, infrared (IR) luminosities of 10(9)-10(12) L-circle dot, combined with other well-calibrated SFR indicators. The PAH luminosity correlates linearly with the SFR as measured by the extinction-corrected H alpha luminosity over the range of luminosities in our calibration sample. The scatter is 0.14 dex, comparable to that between SFRs derived from the Pa alpha and extinction-corrected H alpha emission lines, implying that the PAH features may be as accurate an SFR indicator as hydrogen recombination lines. The PAH SFR relation depends on gas-phase metallicity, for which we supply an empirical correction for galaxies with 0.2 Z(circle dot) < Z less than or similar to 0.7 Z(circle dot) We present a case study in advance of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which will be capable of measuring SFRs from PAHs in distant galaxies at the peak of the SFR density in the universe (z similar to 2) with SFRs as low as similar to 10 M-circle dot yr(-1). We use Spitzer/IRS observations of the PAH features and Paa emission plus Ha measurements in lensed star-forming galaxies at 1 < z < 3 to demonstrate the ability of the PAHs to derive accurate SFRs. We also demonstrate that because the PAH features dominate the mid-IR fluxes, broadband mid-IR photometric measurements from JWST will both. trace. the SFR and provide a way to exclude galaxies dominated by an active galactic nucleus.

AB  - We propose to evaluate the contribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules that carry side groups to the mid-infrared emission spectra. Within this framework, the IR absorption spectra of 2-vinylanthracene (2-VA) and 9-vinylanthracene (9-VA) were measured in Ar matrices at 12 K and in CsI and polyethylene pellets at room temperature. The laboratory spectra were analyzed with the support of simulations based on the density functional theory. For each PAH molecule, eight IR spectra were computed by combining the B3LYP functional with as many different basis sets, namely, 4-31G, 4-31G(d), 6-31G, 6-311G, 6-31G(d), 6-31G(d, p), 6-31+G(d, p), and 6-31++G(d, p). The comparison of the theoretical spectra with the laboratory data allowed us to determine the most suitable combinations for modeling the IR spectra of neutral PAH molecules that carry a vinyl side group. It was concluded from the examples of 2- and 9-VA that the optimum basis set is 6-31G unless a steric interaction has to be taken into account, in which case the optimum basis set is 6-31G(d). Thus, in the presence of such an interaction, the use of d-type polarization functions is recommended. We discuss the possibility for neutral vinyl-substituted PAHs to contribute to the mid-infrared emission spectra and find that their specific features do not match with the mid-infrared aromatic emission bands.

AB  - Low-resolution Spitzer-IRS spectral map data of a reflection nebula (NGC 7023), H II region (M17), and planetary nebula (NGC 40), totaling 1417 spectra, are analyzed using the data and tools available through the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is broken down into PAH charge and size subclass contributions using a database-fitting approach. The resulting charge breakdown results are combined with those derived using the traditional PAH band strength ratio approach, which interprets particular PAH band strength ratios as proxies for PAH charge. Here the 6.2/11.2 pm PAH band strength ratio is successfully calibrated against its database equivalent: the n(PAH)/n(PAH)(0) ratio. In turn, this ratio is converted into the PAH ionization parameter, which relates it to the strength of the radiation field, gas temperature, and electron density. Population diagrams are used to derive the H-2 density and temperature. The bifurcated plot of the 8.6 versus 11.2 pm PAH band strength for the northwest photo dissociation region in NGC 7023 is shown to be a robust diagnostic template for the n(PAH)(+)/n(PAH)(0) ratio in all three objects. Template spectra for the PAH charge and size subclasses are determined for each object and shown to favorably compare. Using the determined template spectra from NGC 7023 to fit the emission in all three objects yields, upon inspection of the Structure SIMilarity maps, satisfactory results. The choice of extinction curve proves to be critical. Concluding, the distinctly different astronomical environments of a reflection nebula, H II region, and planetary nebula are reflected in their PAH emission spectra.

AB  - Using density functional theory, we have investigated the mid-infrared spectral characteristics of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that have straight edges and that contain an even or odd number of carbons. For several even and odd-carbon PAHs, the 8.6/6.2 and 7.6/6.2 intensity ratios computed in emission after the absorption of a 8 eV photon match the observed ratios obtained for three reflection nebulae (RNe), namely NGC 1333, NGC 7023, and NGC 2023. Odd-carbon PAHs are favored, particularly for NGC 1333. Both cations and anions are present, with the cations being predominant. Relevant PAHs span sizes ranging from 46 to 113 carbons for NGC 7023 and NGC 2023 and from 38 to 127 carbons for NGC 1333, and have symmetries ranging from D-2h to C-s. Our work suggests that even- and odd-carbon PAHs with straight edges are viable candidates for the PAH emission seen toward irradiated photodissociation regions.

AB  - We report new correlations between ratios of band intensities of the 15-20 mu m emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a sample of 57 sources observed with the Spitzer/Infrared Spectrograph. This sample includes Large Magellanic Cloud point sources from the SAGE-Spec survey, nearby galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey survey, two Galactic interstellar medium cirrus sources, and the spectral maps of the Galactic reflection nebulae NGC 2023 and NGC 7023. We find that the 16.4, 17.4, and 17.8 mu m band intensities are inter-correlated in all environments. In NGC 2023 and NGC 7023 these bands also correlate with the 11.0 and 12.7 mu m band intensities. The 15.8 mu m band correlates only with the 15-18 mu m plateau and the 11.2 mu m emission. We examine the spatial morphology of these bands and introduce radial cuts. We find that these bands can be spatially organized into three sets: the 12.7, 16.4, and 17.8 mu m bands; the 11.2, 15.8 mu m bands and the 15-18 mu m plateau; and the 11.0 and 17.4 mu m bands. We also find that the spatial distribution of the 12.7, 16.4, and 17.8 mu m bands can be reconstructed by averaging the spatial distributions of the cationic 11.0 mu m and neutral 11.2 mu m bands. We conclude that the 17.4 mu m band is dominated by cations, the 15.8 mu m band by neutral species, and the 12.7, 16.4, and 17.8 mu m bands by a combination of the two. These results highlight the importance of PAH ionization for spatially differentiating sub-populations by their 15-20 mu m emission variability.

AB  - The mid-infrared (IR) spectra of six large, irregular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with formulae (C84H24-C120H36) have been computed using density functional theory (DFT). Trends in the dominant band positions and intensities are compared to those of large, compact PAHs as a function of geometry, size, and charge. Irregular edge moieties that are common in terrestrial PAHs, such as bay regions and rings with quartet hydrogens, are shown to be uncommon in astronomical PAHs. As for all PAHs comprised solely of C and H reported to date, mid-IR emission from irregular PAHs fails to produce a strong CCstr band at 6.2 mu m, the position characteristic of the important, class A astronomical PAH spectra. Earlier studies showed that inclusion of nitrogen within a PAH shifts this to 6.2 mu m for PAH cations. Here we show that this band shifts to 6.3 mu m in nitrogenated PAH anions, close to the position of the CC stretch in class B astronomical PAH spectra. Thus, nitrogenated PAHs may be important in all sources and the peak position of the CC stretch near 6.2 mu m appears to directly reflect the PAH cation to anion ratio. Large irregular PAHs exhibit features at 7.8 mu m but lack them near 8.6 mu m. Hence, the 7.7 mu m astronomical feature is produced by a mixture of small and large PAHs while the 8.6 mu m band can only be produced by large compact PAHs. As with the CCstr, the position and profile of these bands reflect the PAH cation to anion ratio.

AB  - Context. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known to be abundantly present in photon-dominated regions (PDRs), as evidenced by their ubiquitous mid-IR emission bands. Towards dense clouds, however, their IR emission bands are strongly suppressed. It is here where molecules are known to reside on very cold grains (T <= 30 K) in the form of interstellar ices. Therefore, it is likely that non-volatile species, such as PAHs, also freeze out on grains. Such icy grains act as catalytic sites and, upon vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation, chemical reactions are initiated. In the study presented here, these reactions and the resulting photoproducts are investigated for PAH containing water ices.
   Aims. The aim of this work is to monitor vacuum ultraviolet induced chemical reactions of PAHs in cosmic ice through their IR signatures, to characterize the families of species formed in these reactions, and to apply the results to astronomical observations.
   Methods. Mid-infrared Fourier transform absorption spectroscopic measurements ranging from 6500 to 450 cm(-1) are performed on freshly deposited and vacuum ultraviolet processed PAH containing cosmic H2O ices at low temperatures.
   Results. The mid-IR spectroscopy of anthracene, pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene containing H2O ice is reported. Band strengths of the neutral PAH modes in H2O ice are derived. Additionally, spectra of vacuum ultraviolet processed PAH containing H2O ices are presented. These spectra are compared to spectra measured in VUV processed PAH: argon matrix isolation studies. It is concluded that the parent PAH species is ionized in H2O ice and that other photoproducts, mainly more complex PAH derivatives, also form. The importance of PAHs and their PAH:H2O photoproducts in astronomical mid-infrared spectroscopic studies, in particular in the 5-8 mu m region, is discussed. As a test-case, the VUV photolyzed PAH:H2O laboratory spectra are compared to a high resolution ISO-SWS spectrum of the high-mass embedded protostar W33A and to a Spitzer spectrum of the low-mass Young Stellar Object (YSO) RNO 91. For these objects, an upper limit of 2-3% with respect to H2O ice is derived for the contribution of PAHs and PAH: H2O photoproducts to the absorbance in the 5-8 mu m region towards these objects.

AB  - Deuterium (D) is one of the light elements created in the Big Bang. As the Galaxy evolves, the D/H abundance in the interstellar medium (ISM) decreases from its primordial value due to astration. However, the observed gas-phase D/H abundances of some sightlines in the local Galactic ISM are substantially lower than the expected reduction by astration. The missing D could have been depleted onto polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules which are ubiquitous and abundant in interstellar regions. To quantitatively explore the hypothesis of PAHs as a possible reservoir of interstellar D, we quantum-chemically compute the infrared vibrational spectra of monodeuterated PAHs and their cations. We find that, as expected, when H in PAHs is replaced by D, the C-H stretching and bending modes at 3.3, 8.6, and 11.3 mu m shift to longer wavelengths at similar to 4.4, 11.4, and 15.4 mu m, respectively, by a factor of similar to, the difference in reduced mass between the C-H and C-D oscillators. From the computed spectra we derive the mean intrinsic band strengths of the 3.3 mu m C-H stretch and 4.4 mu m C-D stretch to be mu m. By comparing the computationally derived mean band-strength ratio of for neutral PAHs with the mean ratio of the observed intensities of, we find that the degree of deuteration (i.e., the fraction of peripheral atoms attached to C atoms in the form of D) is similar to 2.4%, corresponding to a D enrichment of a factor of similar to 1200 with respect to the interstellar D/H abundance.

AB  - Observationally, the interstellar gas-phase abundance of deuterium (D) is considerably depleted and the missing D atoms are often postulated to have been locked up into carbonaceous solids and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. An accurate knowledge of the fractional amount of D (relative to H) tied up in carbon dust and PAHs has important cosmological implications since D originated exclusively from the Big Bang and the present-day D abundance, after accounting for the astration it has experienced during Galactic evolution, provides essential clues to the primordial nucleosynthesis and the cosmological parameters. To quantitatively explore the extent to which PAHs could possibly accommodate the observed D depletion, we have previously quantum-chemically computed the infrared vibrational spectra of monodeuterated PAHs and derived the mean intrinsic band strengths of the 3.3 mu m C-H stretch (A (3.3)) and the 4.4 mu m C-D stretch (A (4.4)). Here we extend our previous work to multideuterated PAH species of different deuterations, sizes, and structures. We find that both the intrinsic band strengths A (3.3) and A (4.4) (on a per-unit-bond basis) and their ratios A (4.4)/A (3.3) not only show little variation among PAHs of different deuterations, sizes, and structures, they are also closely similar to that of monodeuterated PAHs. Therefore, a PAH deuteration level (i.e., the fraction of peripheral atoms attached to C atoms in the form of D) of similar to 2.4% previously estimated from the observed 4.4 to 3.3 mu m band ratio based on the A (4.4)/A (3.3) ratio of monodeuterated PAHs is robust.

AB  - We decompose the observed 7.7 mu m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission complexes in a large sample of over 7000 mid-infrared spectra of the interstellar medium using spectral cubes observed with the Spitzer/IRS-SL instrument. In order to fit the 7.7 mu m PAH emission complex we invoke four Gaussian components, which are found to be very stable in terms of their peak positions and widths across all of our spectra, and subsequently define a decomposition with fixed parameters, which gives an acceptable fit for all the spectra. We see a strong environmental dependence on the interrelationships between our band fluxes-in the H II regions all four components are intercorrelated, while in the reflection nebulae (RNs) the inner and outer pairs of bands correlate in the same manner as previously seen for NGC. 2023. We show that this effect arises because the maps of RNs are dominated by emission from strongly irradiated photodissociation regions, while the much larger maps of H II regions are dominated by emission from regions much more distant from the exciting stars, leading to subtly different spectral behavior. Further investigation of this dichotomy reveals that the ratio of two of these components (centered at 7.6 and 7.8 mu m) is linearly related to the UV-field intensity (log G(0)). We find that this relationship does not hold for sources consisting of circumstellar material, which are known to have variable 7.7 mu m spectral profiles.

AB  - We present evidence for the existence of an IRAC excess in the spectral energy distribution ( SED) of five galaxies at 0: 6 < z < 0: 9 and one galaxy at z 1.7. These six galaxies, located in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey field (GOODS-N), are star-forming since they present strong 6.2, 7.7, and, 11.3 mu m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) lines in their Spitzer IRS mid-infrared spectra. We use a library of templates computed with PEGASE. 2 to fit their multiwavelength photometry and derive their stellar continuum. Subtraction of the stellar continuum enables us to detect in five galaxies a significant excess in the IRAC band pass where the 3.3 mu m PAH is expected (i.e., IRAC 5.8 mu m for the range of redshifts considered here). We then assess if the physical origin of the IRAC excess is due to an obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) or warm dust emission. For one galaxy evidence of an obscured AGN is found, while the remaining four do not exhibit any significant AGN activity. Possible contamination by warm dust continuum of unknown origin as found in the Galactic diffuse emission is discussed. The properties of such a continuum would have to be different from the local universe to explain the measured IRAC excess, but we cannot definitively rule out this possibility until its origin is understood. Assuming that the IRAC excess is dominated by the 3.3 mu m PAH feature, we find good agreement with the observed 11.3 mu m PAH line flux arising from the same C-H bending and stretching modes, consistent with model expectations. Finally, the IRAC excess appears to be correlated with the star formation rate in the galaxies. Hence it could provide a powerful diagnostic for measuring dusty star formation in z > 3 galaxies once the mid-infrared spectroscopic capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope become available.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a ubiquitous component of the interstellar medium (ISM) in z similar to 0 massive, star-forming galaxies and play key roles in ISM energy balance, chemistry, and shielding. Wide field-of-view, high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) images from JWST provide the ability to map the fraction of dust in the form of PAHs and the properties of these key dust grains at 10-50 pc resolution in galaxies outside the Local Group. We use MIR JWST photometric observations of a sample of 19 nearby galaxies from the Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey to investigate the variations of the PAH fraction. By comparison to lower-resolution far-infrared mapping, we show that a combination of the MIRI filters (R PAH = [F770W+F1130W]/F2100W) traces the fraction of dust by mass in the form of PAHs (i.e., the PAH fraction, or q PAH). Mapping R PAH across the 19 PHANGS galaxies, we find that the PAH fraction steeply decreases in H ii regions, revealing the destruction of these small grains in regions of ionized gas. Outside H ii regions, we find R PAH is constant across the PHANGS sample with an average value of 3.43 +/- 0.98, which, for an illuminating radiation field of intensity 2-5 times that of the radiation field in the solar neighborhood, corresponds to q PAH values of 3%-6%.

AB  - We report the initial results from a Spitzer GO-1 program to obtain low-resolution, mid-infrared spectra of infrared luminous galaxies at z similar to 1-2. This paper presents the spectra of eight sources observed with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). Of the eight spectra, six have mid-IR spectral features, either emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) or silicate absorption. Based on these mid-IR features, the inferred six redshifts are in the range of 1.8-2.6. The remaining two spectra detect only strong continua and thus do not yield redshift information. Strong, multiple PAH emission features are detected in two sources, and weak PAH emission is detected in another two. These data provide direct evidence that PAH molecules are present and directly observable in ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z similar to 2. The six sources with measured redshifts are dusty, infrared luminous galaxies at z similar to 2 with estimated L-bol similar to 10(13) L-circle dot. Of the eight sources, two appear to be starburst dominated; two with only power-law continua are probably type 1 QSOs; and the remaining four are likely composite systems containing a buried active galactic nucleus (AGN) and a starburst component. Since half of our sample contains optically faint sources with R >= 25.5 mag (Vega), our results demonstrate the potential of using mid-infrared spectroscopy, especially the aromatic and silicate features produced by small dust grains, to directly probe optically faint and infrared luminous populations at high redshift.

AB  - We present a charge distribution based model that computes the infrared spectrum of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules using recent measurements or quantum chemical calculations of specific PAHs. The model is applied to a sample of well-studied photodissociation regions (PDRs) with well-determined physical conditions (the radiation field strength, G(0), electron density n(e), and the gas temperature, T-gas). Specifically, we modelled the emission of five PAHs ranging in size from 18 to 96 carbon atoms, over a range of physical conditions characterized by the ionization parameter gamma = G(0) x T-gas(1/)2/n(e). The anions emerge as the dominant charge carriers in low gamma (<2 x 10(2)) environments, neutrals in the intermediate gamma (10(3) - 10(4)) environments, and cations in the high gamma (>10(5)) environments. Furthermore, the PAH anions and cations exhibit similar spectral characteristics. The similarity in the cationic and anionic spectra translates into the interpretation of the 6.2/(11.0+11.2) band ratio, with high values of this ratio associated with large contributions from either cations or anions. The model's predicted values of 6.2/(11.0+11.2) and 3.3/6.2 compared well to the observations in the PDRs NGC 7023, NGC 2023, the horsehead nebula, the Orion bar, and the diffuse interstellar medium, demonstrating that changes in the charge state can account for the variations in the observed PAH emission. We also reassess the diagnostic potential of the 6.2/(11.0+11.2) versus 3.3/(11.0+11.2) ratios and show that without any prior knowledge about gamma, the 3.3/(11.0+11.2) can predict the PAH size, but the 6.21(11.0 + 11.2) cannot predict the gamma of the astrophysical environment.

AB  - On the basis of observations by Spitzer and Herschel, we present and analyse the correlations between various monochromatic infrared (IR) luminosities for star-forming galaxies, selected from two northern Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) fields. The 24- and 70-mu m luminosities (L[24] and L[70]), which are dominated by the continuum of very small grains (VSGs) and warm dust in thermal equilibrium, respectively, correlate tightly with ongoing star formation. The contribution from cool dust excited by evolved stars also increases as the wavelength increases in the far-infrared (FIR) wavelength range. The spectral features of ionized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) around rest-frame 8 mu m are excited by the moderated radiation field related to evolved stars as well, rather than by the intensive radiation field related to young stars. Even though the carriers of PAHs could be treated as types of VSG with a smaller scale, the radiation condition between PAHs and classic VSGs seems to be significantly different. The formulae to calculate the total infrared luminosity L-TIR using L[8(dust)] and L[24] are re-scaled and we find that the L[8(dust)] (L[24]) formula likely underestimates (overestimates) L-TIR for galaxies with unusualcurrent star formation activity.

AB  - We present maps of the 3.3 mu m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission feature in NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 as observed with the Near-Infrared Camera imager on JWST from the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury project. We create maps that isolate the 3.3 mu m PAH feature in the F335M filter (F335M(PAH)) using combinations of the F300M and F360M filters for removal of starlight continuum. This continuum removal is complicated by contamination of the F360M by PAH emission and variations in the stellar spectral energy distribution slopes between 3.0 and 3.6 mu m. We modify the empirical prescription from Lai et al. to remove the starlight continuum in our highly resolved galaxies, which have a range of starlight- and PAH-dominated lines of sight. Analyzing radially binned profiles of the F335M(PAH) emission, we find that between 5% and 65% of the F335M intensity comes from the 3.3 mu m feature within the inner 0.5 r (25) of our targets. This percentage systematically varies from galaxy to galaxy and shows radial trends within the galaxies related to each galaxy's distribution of stellar mass, interstellar medium, and star formation. The 3.3 mu m emission is well correlated with the 11.3 mu m PAH feature traced with the MIRI F1130W filter, as is expected, since both features arise from C-H vibrational modes. The average F335M(PAH)/F1130W ratio agrees with the predictions of recent models by Draine et al. for PAHs with size and charge distributions shifted toward larger grains with normal or higher ionization.

AB  - JWST observations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission provide some of the deepest and highest resolution views of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. If PAHs are well mixed with the atomic and molecular gas and illuminated by the average diffuse interstellar radiation field, PAH emission may provide an approximately linear, high-resolution, high-sensitivity tracer of diffuse gas surface density. We present a pilot study that explores using PAH emission in this way based on Mid-Infrared Instrument observations of IC 5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 from the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS-JWST Treasury. Using scaling relationships calibrated in Leroy et al., scaled F1130W provides 10-40 pc resolution and 3 sigma sensitivity of sigma(gas) similar to 2 M (circle dot) pc(-2). We characterize the surface densities of structures seen at M (circle dot) pc(-2) in our targets, where we expect the gas to be H i-dominated. We highlight the existence of filaments, interarm emission, and holes in the diffuse ISM at these low surface densities. Below similar to 10 M (circle dot) pc(-2) for NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 the gas distribution shows a "Swiss cheese"-like topology due to holes and bubbles pervading the relatively smooth distribution of the diffuse ISM. Comparing to recent galaxy simulations, we observe similar topology for the low-surface-density gas, though with notable variations between simulations with different setups and resolution. Such a comparison of high-resolution, low-surface-density gas with simulations is not possible with existing atomic and molecular gas maps, highlighting the unique power of JWST maps of PAH emission.

AB  - We investigate the emergence phase of young star clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628. We use JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations to create spatially resolved maps of the Pa alpha 1.87 mu m and Br alpha 4.05 mu m hydrogen recombination lines, as well as 3.3 and 7.7 mu m emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extract 953 compact H ii regions and analyze the PAH emission and morphology at similar to 10 pc scales in the associated photodissociation regions. While H ii regions remain compact, radial profiles help us to define three PAH morphological classes: compact (similar to 42%), extended (similar to 34%), and open (similar to 24%). The majority of compact and extended PAH morphologies are associated with very young star clusters (<5 Myr), while open PAH morphologies are mainly associated with star clusters older than 3 Myr. We observe a general decrease in the 3.3 and 7.7 mu m PAH band emission as a function of cluster age, while their ratio remains constant with age out to 10 Myr and morphological class. The recovered PAH(3.3 mu m)/PAH(7.7 mu m) ratio is lower than values reported in the literature for reference models that consider neutral and ionized PAH populations and analyses conducted at galactic physical scales. The 3.3 and 7.7 mu m bands are typically associated with neutral and ionized PAHs, respectively. While we expected neutral PAHs to be suppressed in proximity to an ionizing source, the constant PAH(3.3 mu m)/PAH(7.7 mu m) ratio would indicate that both families of molecules disrupt at similar rates in proximity to H ii regions.

AB  - We report spectra obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope in the lambda = 5-35 mu m range of HD 233517, an evolved K2 III giant with circumstellar dust. For lambda < 13 mu m, the flux is a smooth continuum that varies approximately as nu(-5/3). For lambda < 13 mu m, although the star is oxygen-rich, PAH features produced by carbon-rich species at 6.3, 8.2, 11.3, and 12.7 mu m are detected along with likely broad silicate emission near 20 mu m. These results can be explained if there is a passive, flared disk orbiting HD 233517. Our data support the hypothesis that organic molecules in orbiting disks may be synthesized in situ as well as having been incorporated from the interstellar medium.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in the Spitzer-IRS spectralmap of the northwest photon dominated region (PDR) in NGC 7023 is analyzed using the "traditional" approach in which the PAH bands and plateaus between 5.2-19.5 mu m are isolated by subtracting the underlying continuum and removing H-2 emission lines. The spectra are organized into seven spectroscopic bins by using k-means clustering. Each cluster corresponds to, and reveals, a morphological zone within NGC 7023. The zones self-organize parallel to the well-defined PDR front that coincides with an increase in intensity of the H-2 emission lines. PAH band profiles and integrated strengths are measured, classified, and mapped. The morphological zones revealed by the k-means clustering provides deeper insight into the conditions that drive variations in band strength ratios and evolution of the PAH population that otherwise would be lost. For example, certain band-band relations are bifurcated, revealing two limiting cases; one associated with the PDR, the other with the diffuse medium. Traditionally, PAH band strength ratios are used to gain insight into the properties of the emitting PAH population, i.e., charge, size, structure, and composition. Insights inferred from this work are compared and contrasted to those from Boersma et al. (first paper in this series), where the PAH emission in NGC 7023 is decomposed exclusively using the PAH spectra and tools made available through the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database.

AB  - We present results of mid-infrared spectroscopic mapping observations of six star-forming regions in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) from the Spitzer Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC ((SMC)-M-4). We detect the mid-IR emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in all of the mapped regions, greatly increasing the range of environments where PAHs have been spectroscopically detected in the SMC. We investigate the variations of the mid-IR bands in each region and compare our results to studies of the PAH bands in the SINGS sample and in a sample of low-metallicity starburst galaxies. PAH emission in the SMC is characterized by low ratios of the 6-9 mu m features relative to the 11.3 mu m feature and weak 8.6 and 17.0 mu m features. Interpreting these band ratios in the light of laboratory and theoretical studies, we find that PAHs in the SMC tend to be smaller and less ionized than those in higher metallicity galaxies. Based on studies of PAH destruction, we argue that a size distribution shifted toward smaller PAHs cannot be the result of processing in the interstellar medium, but instead reflects differences in the formation of PAHs at low metallicity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our observations for our understanding of the PAH life-cycle in low-metallicity galaxies-namely that the observed deficit of PAHs may be a consequence of PAHs forming with smaller average sizes and therefore being more susceptible to destruction under typical interstellar medium conditions.

AB  - We report the results of a Spitzer infrared (IR) study of the Cosmic Eye, a strongly lensed, L-UV* Lyman break galaxy (LBG) at z = 3.074. We obtained Spitzer mid-IR spectroscopy as well as MIPS 24 and 70 mu m photometry. The Eye is detected with high significance at both 24 and 70 mu m and, when including a flux limit at 3.5 mm, we estimate an IR luminosity of L-IR = 8.3(-4.4)(+4.7) x 10(11) L-circle dot assuming a magnification of 28 +/- 3. This L-IR is eight times lower than that predicted from the rest-frame ultraviolet properties assuming a Calzetti reddening law. This has also been observed in other young LBGs, and indicates that the dust reddening law may be steeper in these galaxies. The mid-IR spectrum shows strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 6.2 and 7.7 mu m, with equivalent widths near the maximum values observed in star-forming galaxies at any redshift. The L-PAH-to-L-IR ratio lies close to the relation measured in local starbursts. Therefore, L-PAH or L-MIR may be used to estimate LIR, and thus star formation rate, of LBGs, whose fluxes at longer wavelengths are typically below current confusion limits. We also report the highest redshift detection of the 3.3 mu m PAH emission feature. The PAH ratio, L-6.2/L-3.3 = 5.1 +/- 2.7, and the PAH-to-L-IR ratio, L-3.3/L-IR = 8.5 +/- 4.7 x 10(-4), are both in agreement with measurements in local starbursts and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), suggesting that this line may serve as a good proxy for L-PAH or L-IR at z > 3 with the James Webb Space Telescope.

AB  - Despite its biogenic and astrochemical importance, sulfur (S), the 10th most abundant element in the interstellar medium (ISM) with a total abundance of S/H approximate to 2.2 x 10-5, largely remains undetected in molecular clouds. Even in the diffuse ISM where S was previously often believed to be fully in the gas phase, in recent years, observational evidence has suggested that S may also be appreciably depleted from the gas. What might be the dominant S reservoir in the ISM remains unknown. Solid sulfides like MgS, FeS, and SiS2 are excluded as major S reservoirs due to the nondetection of their expected infrared spectral bands in the ISM. In this work, we explore the potential role of sulfurated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules-PAHs with sulfur heterocycles (PASHs)-as a sink for the missing S. Utilizing density function theory, we compute the vibrational spectra of 18 representative PASH molecules. It is found that these molecules exhibit a prominent C-S stretching band at similar to 10 mu m and two relatively weak C-S deformation bands at 15 and 25 mu m that are not mixed with the nominal PAH bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 mu m. If several parts per million of S (relative to H) are locked up in PAHs, the 10 mu m C-S band would be detectable by Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To quantitatively explore the amount of S/H depleted in PASHs, a detailed comparison of the infrared emission spectra of PASHs with the Spitzer and JWST observations is needed.

AB  - Spectral and photometric observations of nearby galaxies show a correlation between the strength of their mid-IR aromatic features, attributed to PAH molecules, and their metal abundances, leading to a deficiency of these features in low-metallicity galaxies. In this paper we suggest that the observed correlation represents a trend of PAH abundance with galactic age, reflecting the delayed injection of carbon dust into the ISM by AGB stars in the final post-AGB phase of their evolution. AGB stars are the primary sources of PAHs and carbon dust in galaxies, and recycle their ejecta back to the ISM after only a few hundred million years of evolution on the main sequence. In contrast, more massive stars that explode as Type II supernovae inject their metals and dust almost instantaneously after their formation. We first determined the PAH abundance in galaxies by constructing detailed models of UV-to-radio SEDs of galaxies that estimate the contribution of dust in PAH-free H II regions, and of PAHs and dust in photodissociation regions, to the IR emission. All model components, the galaxies' stellar content, the properties of their H II regions, and their ionizing and nonionizing radiation fields and dust abundances, are constrained by their observed multiwavelength spectra. After determining the PAH and dust abundances in 35 nearby galaxies using our SED model, we use a chemical evolution model to show that the delayed injection of carbon dust by AGB stars provides a natural explanation for the dependence of the PAH content in galaxies on metallicity. We also show that larger dust particles giving rise to the far-IR emission follow a distinct evolutionary trend closely related to the injection of dust by massive stars into the ISM.

AB  - The mid-infrared spectra of large PAHs ranging from C54H18 to C130H28 are determined computationally using density functional theory. Trends in the band positions and intensities as a function of PAH size, charge, and geometry are discussed. Regarding the 3.3, 6.3, and 11.2 mu m bands similar conclusions hold as with small PAHs. This does not hold for the other features. The larger PAH cations and anions produce bands at 7.8 mu m and, as PAH sizes increases, a band near 8.5 mu m becomes prominent and shifts slightly to the red. In addition, the average anion peak falls slightly to the red of the average cation peak. The similarity in behavior of the 7.8 and 8.6 mu m bands with the astronomical observations suggests that they arise from large, cationic and anionic PAHs, with the specific peak position and profile reflecting the PAH cation to anion concentration ratio and relative intensities of PAH size. Hence, the broad astronomical 7.7 mu m band is produced by a mixture of small and large PAH cations and anions, with small and large PAHs contributing more to the 7.6 and 7.8 mu m components, respectively. For the CH out-of-plane vibrations, the duo hydrogens couple with the solo vibrations and produce bands that fall at wavelengths slightly different than their counterparts in smaller PAHs. As a consequence, previously deduced PAH structures are altered in favor of more compact and symmetric forms. In addition, the overlap between the duo and trio bands may reproduce the blue-shaded 12.8 mu m profile.

AB  - Archival observations of 18 starburst galaxies that span a wide range in metallicity reveal for the first time a correlation between the ratio of emission-line fluxes of [Fe II] at 26 mu m and [Ne II] at 12.8 mu m and the 7.7 mu m PAH strength, with the [Fe II]/[Ne II] flux ratio decreasing with increasing PAH strength. We also find a strong correlation between the [Fe II]/[Ne II] flux ratio and the host galaxy metallicity, with the flux ratio decreasing with increasing metallicity. Since [Fe II] emission has been linked primarily to supernova shocks, we attribute the high [Fe II]/[Ne II] ratios in low-metallicity galaxies to enhanced supernova activity. We consider this to be a dominant mechanism for PAH destruction, rather than grain destruction in photoionized regions surrounding young massive stars. We also consider whether the extreme youth of the low-metallicity galaxies is responsible for the lack of PAH emission.

AB  - Low-resolution Spitzer spectral map data. (> 1700 spectra) of ten reflection nebulae (RNe) fields are analyzed using the data and tools available through the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database. The PAH emission is broken down into PAH charge state using a database fitting approach. Here, the physics of the PAH emission process is taken into account and uses target appropriate parameters, e.g., a stellar radiation model for the exciting star. The breakdown results are combined with results derived using the traditional PAH band strength approach, which interprets particular PAH band strength ratios as proxies for the PAH charge state, e.g., the 6.2/11.2. mu m PAH band strength ratio. These are successfully calibrated against their database equivalent; the PAH ionized fraction (f(i)). The PAH ionized fraction is converted into the PAH ionization parameter, which relates the PAH ionized fraction to the strength of the radiation field, gas temperature and electron density. The behavior of the 12.7. mu m PAH band is evaluated as a tracer for PAH ionization and erosion. The plot of the 8.6 versus 11.2 mu m PAH band strength for the northwest photo-dominated region (PDR) in NGC. 7023 is shown to be a robust diagnostic template for the PAH ionized fraction. Remarkably, most of the other RNe fall within the limits set by NGC. 7023. Finally, PAH spectroscopic templates are constructed and verified as principal components. Template spectra derived from NGC. 7023 and NGC. 2023 compare extremely well with each other, with those derived for NGC. 7023 successfully reproducing the PAH emission observed from NGC. 2023.

AB  - We present a sample of low-resolution 5-38 mu m Spitzer IRS spectra of the inner few square kiloparsecs of 59 nearby galaxies spanning a large range of star formation properties. A robust method for decomposing mid-infrared galaxy spectra is described and used to explore the behavior of PAH emission and the prevalence of silicate dust extinction. Evidence for silicate extinction is found in similar to (1)/(8) of the sample, at strengths that indicate that most normal galaxies undergo A(V) less than or similar to 3 mag averaged over their centers. The contribution of PAH emission to the total infrared power is found to peak near 10% and extend up to similar to 20% and is suppressed at metallicities Z less than or similar to Z circle dot/4, as well as in low-luminosity AGN environments. Strong interband PAH feature strength variations (2-5 times) are observed, with the presence of a weak AGN and, to a lesser degree, increasing metallicity shifting power to the longer wavelength bands. A peculiar PAH emission spectrum with markedly diminished 5-8 mu m features arises among the sample solely in systems with relatively hard radiation fields harboring low-luminosity AGNs. The AGNs may modify the emitting grain distribution and provide the direct excitation source of the unusual PAH emission, which cautions against using absolute PAH strength to estimate star formation rates in systems harboring active nuclei. Alternatively, the low star formation intensity often associated with weak AGNs may affect the spectrum. The effect of variations in the mid-infrared spectrum on broadband infrared surveys is modeled and points to more than a factor of 2 uncertainty in results that assume a fixed PAH emission spectrum, for redshifts z = 0-2.5.

AB  - With the aim of constructing accurate two-dimensional maps of the stellar mass distribution in nearby galaxies from Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies 3.6 and 4.5 mu m images, we report on the separation of the light from old stars from the emission contributed by contaminants. Results for a small sample of six disk galaxies (NGC 1566, NGC 2976, NGC 3031, NGC 3184, NGC 4321, and NGC 5194) with a range of morphological properties, dust content, and star formation histories are presented to demonstrate our approach. To isolate the old stellar light from contaminant emission (e.g., hot dust and the 3.3 mu m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature) in the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 mu m bands we use an independent component analysis (ICA) technique designed to separate statistically independent source distributions, maximizing the distinction in the [3.6]-[4.5] colors of the sources. The technique also removes emission from evolved red objects with a low mass-to-light ratio, such as asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red supergiant (RSG) stars, revealing maps of the underlying old distribution of light with [3.6]-[4.5] colors consistent with the colors of K and M giants. The contaminants are studied by comparison with the non-stellar emission imaged at 8 mu m, which is dominated by the broad PAH feature. Using the measured 3.6 mu m/8 mu m ratio to select individual contaminants, we find that hot dust and PAHs together contribute between similar to 5% and 15% to the integrated light at 3.6 mu m, while light from regions dominated by intermediate-age (AGB and RSG) stars accounts for only 1%-5%. Locally, however, the contribution from either contaminant can reach much higher levels; dust contributes on average 22% to the emission in star-forming regions throughout the sample, while intermediate-age stars contribute upward of 50% in localized knots. The removal of these contaminants with ICA leaves maps of the old stellar disk that retain a high degree of structural information and are ideally suited for tracing stellar mass, as will be the focus in a companion paper.

AB  - We present Spitzer observations of the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 1705 obtained as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey. The galaxy morphology is very different shortward and longward of similar to 5 mu m: optical and short-wavelength IRAC imaging shows an underlying red stellar population, with the central super star cluster (SSC) dominating the luminosity; longer wavelength IRAC and MIPS imaging reveals warm dust emission arising from two off-nuclear regions that are offset by similar to 250 pc from the SSC and that dominate the far-IR flux of the system. These regions show little extinction at optical wavelengths. The galaxy has a relatively low global dust mass (similar to 2 x 10(5) M-circle dot, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio similar to 2-4 times lower than the Milky Way average, roughly consistent with the metallicity decrease). The off-nuclear dust emission appears to be powered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for the excitation of the observed H alpha emission; these photons are unassociated with the SSC (although a contribution from embedded sources to the IR luminosity of the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out). Low-resolution IRS spectroscopy shows moderate-strength PAH emission in the 11.3 mu m band in the more luminous eastern peak; no PAH emission is detected in the SSC or the western dust emission complex. There is significant diffuse emission in the IRAC 8 mu m band after starlight has been removed by scaling shorter wavelength data; the fact that IRS spectroscopy shows spatially variable PAH emission strengths compared to the local continuum within this diffuse gas suggests caution in the interpretation of IRAC diffuse 8 mu m emission as arising from PAH carriers alone. The nebular metallicity of NGC 1705 falls at the transition level of similar to 0.35 Z(circle dot) found by Engelbracht and collaborators, below which PAH emission is difficult to detect; the fact that a system at this metallicity shows spatially variable PAH emission demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8 mu m emission in galaxies. NGC 1705 deviates significantly from the canonical far-infrared versus radio correlation, having significant far-infrared emission but no detected radio continuum.

AB  - The PAH emission in Spitzer-IRS spectral maps of the reflection nebula NGC 2023 have been previously studied using a Gaussian decomposition method for the 7-9 mu m region and a database-fitting approach. Both studies provided insight into the spatial-spectral evolution of the PAH population and related them to changing local physical conditions. This study investigates whether the database-fitting technique provides insight into the PAH populations at the origin of the four Gaussian components. To this end, clustered PAH species maps and spectra are generated from the database-fitting results using spectral clustering utilizing the Structural Similarity Index as an affinity measure. The application of spectral clustering solely based on spatial structure is strongly dependent on the anatomy of the considered regions and is unable to align specific morphological features with a PAH population characterized by a single distinct property. However, in the south FOV the projected distance from the star of the peak emission in a cluster map correlates with the PAH cation fraction and the cluster dominated by small PAHs is confined to the S and SSE ridges, consistent with results from Knight et al. Furthermore, the cluster and Gaussian maps exhibit limited morphological similarity and the 7-9 mu m cluster spectra do not show consistent overlap with any of the Gaussian components. However, the relative strengths of the Gaussian components strongly correlate with the PAH ionization parameter as determined from the database-fitting approach. This lends further support to the existence of at least two sub-populations contributing to the 7-9 mu m PAH emission.

AB  - We present a focused study of radially resolved varying PAH emission in the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN)-host NGC 4138 using deep Spitzer/infrared spectrograph spectral maps. Using new model PAH spectra, we investigate whether these variations could be associated with changes to the PAH grain size distribution due to photodestruction by the AGN. Separately, we model the effects of the varying radiation field within NGC 4138, and we use this model to predict the corresponding changes in the PAH emission spectrum. We find that PAH band ratios are strongly variable with radius in this galaxy with short-to-long wavelength band ratios peaking in the starburst ring. The changing mix of starlight appears to have a considerable effect on the trends in these band ratios, and our radiation model predicts the shapes of these trends. However, the amplitude of observed variation is similar to 2.5 x larger than predicted for some ratios. A cutoff of small grains in the PAH size distribution, as has been suggested for AGN, together with changes in PAH ionization fraction could explain the behavior of the shorter bands, but this model fails to reproduce longer band behaviors. Additionally, we find that short-to-long wavelength PAH band ratios increase slightly within similar to 270 pc of the center, suggesting that the AGN may directly influence PAH emission there.

AB  - We present Spitzer 4.5 and 8.0 mu m imaging of 15 Local Group and nearby dwarf galaxies. We find that the diffuse 8 mu m emission is spatially correlated with regions of active star formation. Our sample spans a range of > 1 dex in nebular metallicity and 3 orders of magnitude in current star formation rate, allowing us to examine the dependence of emission from hot dust and PAHs on these parameters. We detect prominent diffuse 8 mu m emission from the four most luminous galaxies in the sample (IC 1613, IC 5152, NGC 55, and NGC 3109) and only very low surface brightness emission from four others (DDO 216, Sextans A, Sextans B, and WLM). These are the first spatially resolved images of diffuse 8 mu m emission from such low-metallicity objects [12 + log (O/H) similar to 7: 5]. We observe correlations of this emission with the current star formation rate and the nebular metallicity of these galaxies. However, we also see evidence suggesting that other processes may also have a significant effect on the generation of this emission. These systems all have evidence for old and intermediate-age star formation; thus, the lack of diffuse 8 mu m emission cannot be attributed to low galaxy ages. Also, winds cannot explain the paucity of this emission, since high- resolution imaging of the neutral gas in these objects shows no evidence of blowout. We propose that the lack of diffuse 8 mu m emission in low-metallicity systems may be due to the destruction of dust grains by supernova shocks, assuming a long timescale to regrow dust. It is likely that the observed weak emission is at least partly due to a general absence of dust (including PAHs), in agreement with their low metallicities.

AB  - Utilizing the data and tools provided through the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb), we study the PAH component of over 900 Spitzer-IRS galaxy spectra. Employing a database-fitting approach, the average PAH size, the PAH size distribution, and PAH ionization fraction are deduced. In turn, we examine their connection with the properties of the host galaxy. We found that PAH population within galaxies consists of middle-sized PAHs with an average number of carbon atoms of (N-C) over bar = 55, and a charge state distribution of similar to 40% ionized-60% neutral. We describe a correlation between the 6.2/11.2 mu m PAH ratio with the ionization parameter (gamma  (G(0)/n(e))(T-gas/1 K)(0.5)), a moderate correlation between the 8.6/11.2 mu m PAH ratio and specific star formation rate, and a weak anticorrelation between gamma and M-*. From the PAHdb decomposition, we provide estimates for the 3.3 mu m PAH band, not covered by Spitzer observations, and establish a correlation between the 3.3/11.2 mu m PAH ratio with N-C. We further deliver a library of mid-IR PAH template spectra parameterized on PAH size and ionization fraction, which can be used in galaxy spectral energy distribution fitting codes for the modeling of the mid-IR PAH emission component in galaxies.
